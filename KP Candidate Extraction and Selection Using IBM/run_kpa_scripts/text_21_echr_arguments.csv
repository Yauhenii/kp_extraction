1,21.txt,"In these circumstances, the Commission did not find it necessary to examine whether the detention was ""lawful"" under domestic law."
2,21.txt,"The applicant, for his part, stressed that the decisions leading to the charges against him and his being detained on remand had been taken collectively by the government at the time and in a manner which was consistent with the relevant law, including the then Bulgarian Constitution; the allocation of the funds in question had been effected in accordance with the national budget as adopted by the National Assembly and had subsequently been approved by the latter."
3,21.txt,The measures had been in keeping not only with the policies of the government at the time but also with relevant United Nations resolutions on development assistance. 
4,21.txt,"They had not benefited any members of the government or any third parties; the funds had been received in their entirety by the addressee countries."
5,21.txt,The Government maintained before the Commission that the applicant’s detention had been effected on the grounds of suspicion of his having committed a crime and had been in conformity with Bulgarian law.
6,21.txt,"Although it was true that the allocation of development aid had not as such constituted a criminal offence, the charges in question had been brought because the transfers of funds had, under the cover of development assistance, involved improper ""deals"" causing damage to Bulgaria’s economic interests."
7,21.txt,"The Government were, however, not in a position to provide any details of such ""deals"" as it would adversely affect the confidentiality of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant and eight other former government members."
8,21.txt,"Before the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above)."
9,21.txt," The Prosecutor-General’s submission on the applicant’s complaints included the following observations."
10,21.txt,It was a key element of the offence of misappropriation under Bulgarian law that the offender had dealt with someone else’s property as though it had been his or her own and had thereby infringed the owner’s interests; it was not decisive whether he or she had sought to obtain an advantage for himself or herself or for a third party (see paragraph 26 above).
11,21.txt,"Furthermore, members of a body could by reason of their joint decisions and actions be found guilty if they had thereby knowingly committed acts which amounted to an offence."
12,21.txt,"In the present case, since the collective decisions concerned had caused economic loss, criminal proceedings had been instituted against each member of the body which had taken those decisions (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above)."
13,21.txt,"The prosecutor had believed that the funds concerned had been spent in a manner which was unlawful since there was no information as to whether they had appeared in the budget as an expenditure."
14,21.txt,"Admittedly, the Prosecutor-General had not been in a position at the time to ascertain whether there was criminal intent."
15,21.txt,"He had considered, having regard to the circumstances and complexity of the case, that this could only be determined in the course of the preliminary investigations."
16,21.txt,"Although not expressly stated in the order to detain the applicant on remand, the decision had been taken in view of who the applicant was and the gravity of the offence committed (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above)."
17,21.txt,The Supreme Court too had laid stress on the applicant’s status as a member of the National Assembly (see paragraph 13 above).
18,21.txt,The extremely wide powers which he had enjoyed by virtue of his position had given him greater opportunities to abscond or commit further offences than he would have had otherwise.
19,21.txt,"Furthermore, his position in society, his numerous contacts abroad and his repeated requests that the authorities return his passport, were all considerations which went to justify placing him in pre-trial detention."

21,21.txt,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Foti and Others v. Italy judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 21, para. 63)."

23,21.txt, Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) contains an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty which must be interpreted strictly
24,21.txt,"The Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was ""lawful"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected ""in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law""."
25,21.txt,"(see, for instance, the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54; and the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 752-53, para. 40)."
26,21.txt,"Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that it is undisputed that the applicant had, as a member of the Bulgarian Government, taken part in the decisions - granting funds in assistance and loans to certain developing countries - which had given rise to the charges against him."
27,21.txt," However, none of the provisions of the Criminal Code relied on to justify the detention - Articles 201 to 203, 219 and 282 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) - specified or even implied that anyone could incur criminal liability by taking part in collective decisions of this nature."
28,21.txt,"Moreover, no evidence has been adduced to show that such decisions were unlawful, that is to say contrary to Bulgaria’s Constitution or legislation, or more specifically that the decisions were taken in excess of powers or were contrary to the law on the national budget."
29,21.txt,"In the light of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the conduct for which the applicant was prosecuted constituted a criminal offence under Bulgarian law at the relevant time."
30,21.txt," What is more, the public prosecutor’s order of detention of 9 July 1992 and the Supreme Court’s decision of 13 July upholding the order referred to Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 13 and 25 above)."
31,21.txt,"As appears from the case-law supplied to the Court, a constituent element of the offence of misappropriation under Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code was that the offender had sought to obtain for himself or herself or for a third party an advantage (see paragraph 26 above)."
32,21.txt,"The order of 9 July in addition referred to Article 282 which specifically makes it an offence for a public servant to abuse his or her power in order to obtain such advantage (see paragraphs 9 and 28 above)."
33,21.txt,"However, the Court has not been provided with any fact or information capable of showing that the applicant was at the time reasonably suspected of having sought to obtain for himself or a third party an advantage from his participation in the allocation of funds in question"
34,21.txt," In this connection it is to be noted that the Government’s submission that there had been certain ""deals"" was found by the Commission to be unsubstantiated and was not reiterated before the Court."
35,21.txt,"Indeed, it was not contended before the Convention institutions that the funds had not been received by the States concerned."
36,21.txt,"(see, for instance, the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 25, para. 51)."
37,21.txt," In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty during the period under consideration was ""lawful detention"" effected ""on reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence""."
38,21.txt," The applicant alleged that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), which, in so far as relevant, reads:
""Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;"
39,21.txt,"The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, was of the opinion that the facts which had been invoked against him at the time of his arrest and during his continued detention (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 13 above) could not, in the eyes of an objective observer, be construed as misappropriation of funds or as a breach of official duties aimed at facilitating the commission of such an offence."
40,21.txt,"(see, for instance, the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54; and the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 752-53, para. 40)."
