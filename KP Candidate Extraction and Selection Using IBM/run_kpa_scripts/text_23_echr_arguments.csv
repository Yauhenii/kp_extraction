1,23.txt," Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
2,23.txt,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  
3,23.txt,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
4,23.txt,"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 18 above). "
5,23.txt,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
6,23.txt,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
7,23.txt,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison. "
8,23.txt,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
9,23.txt,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions. "
10,23.txt,"It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.  "
11,23.txt,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
12,23.txt,"  Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
13,23.txt,"Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  "
14,23.txt,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
15,23.txt,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here. "
16,23.txt,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.  "
17,23.txt,"They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case. "
18,23.txt,"The Court notes that Mr Palaoro based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
19,23.txt,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
20,23.txt,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied. "
21,23.txt,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
22,23.txt,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
23,23.txt,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
24,23.txt,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
25,23.txt,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  "
26,23.txt,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
27,23.txt,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  "
28,23.txt,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
29,23.txt,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
30,23.txt,  The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
31,23.txt," It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
32,23.txt,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
33,23.txt,"It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  "
34,23.txt,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
35,23.txt," It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"". "
36,23.txt,"(see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47)."
37,23.txt, It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred
