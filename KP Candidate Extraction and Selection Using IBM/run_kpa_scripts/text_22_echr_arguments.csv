1,22.txt,The Court sees no reason to depart from the general approach it has adopted in previous cases of a similar nature.
2,22.txt,"(see, inter alia, the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 15, para. 28, citing the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 27, para. 48)."
3,22.txt,"They also pointed to a number of other facts capable of supporting, albeit indirectly, the reasonableness of the suspicion, including notably the findings made by the domestic courts in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, the very recent conviction of her brothers in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her own visits to the USA and her contacts with her brothers there (see especially paragraphs 10, 19, 24, 25, 28 and 29 above)."
4,22.txt,"Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism."
5,22.txt,"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention."
6,22.txt,She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one.
7,22.txt,She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion.
8,22.txt,"In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D.
54.  For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley."
9,22.txt,It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers.
10,22.txt," With regard to the level of ""suspicion"", the Court would note firstly that, as was observed in its judgment in the case of Brogan and Others, ""sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) does not presuppose that the [investigating authorities] should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while [the arrested person is] in custody."
11,22.txt,"Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others"" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53)."
12,22.txt,The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.
13,22.txt,"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation."
14,22.txt,The length of the deprivation of liberty at risk may also be material to the level of suspicion required.
15,22.txt," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
16,22.txt," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
17,22.txt,The Court would firstly reiterate its recognition that the use of confidential information is essential in combating terrorist violence and the threat that organised terrorism poses to the lives of citizens and to democratic society as a whole
18,22.txt,"(see also the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 48)."
19,22.txt,"This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49)."
20,22.txt,"As to the present case, the terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland, the carnage it has caused over the years and the active engagement of the Provisional IRA in that campaign are established beyond doubt."
21,22.txt,The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law.
22,22.txt,"That finding is not altered by the fact that the terms of the applicable legislation were amended in 1987 as a result of the Baker Report so as to include a requirement that the arrest should be based on reasonable, rather than merely honest, suspicion (see paragraph 37 above)."
23,22.txt,The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.
24,22.txt,"Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition ""furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (see paragraph 51 above)."
25,22.txt,"In this connection, unlike in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Convention institutions have had the benefit of the review that the national courts conducted of the facts and of Mrs Murray’s allegations in the civil proceedings brought by her."
26,22.txt,"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention."
27,22.txt,At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.
28,22.txt,"In the action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, the High Court judge, after having heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility, found that she had genuinely been suspected of having been involved in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms in the USA for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 24 above)."
29,22.txt,"The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a ""transparently honest witness"", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above)."
30,22.txt,"Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above)."
31,22.txt,Some weeks before her arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had been convicted in the USA of offences connected with purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).
32,22.txt,"As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above)."
33,22.txt,"The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland."
34,22.txt," Having regard to the level of factual justification required at the stage of suspicion and to the special exigencies of investigating terrorist crime, the Court finds, in the light of all the above considerations, that there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs Murray may have committed the offence of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA. "
35,22.txt,"She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above)."
36,22.txt,"However, in this context it is not normally within the province of the Court to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them"
37,22.txt,"(see, among other authorities, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 19-20, para. 43, in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e); and the Klaas v. Germany judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, para. 29, in relation to Article 3 (art. 3))."
38,22.txt,In the present case no cogent elements have been produced by the first applicant in the proceedings before the Convention institutions which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact made by the Northern Ireland courts.
39,22.txt, Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above).
40,22.txt,"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53)."
41,22.txt,"As the domestic courts pointed out (see paragraphs 25 in fine, 29 in fine and 34 in fine above), in view of her persistent refusal to answer any questions at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 19 above) it is not surprising that the authorities were not able to make any headway in pursuing the suspicions against her."
42,22.txt,"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority."
43,22.txt,What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form.
44,22.txt,"Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive."
45,22.txt,The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).
46,22.txt,"The first applicant also alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, which provides:"
47,22.txt,"""Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him."""
48,22.txt,"Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA."
49,22.txt,"The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D.
74.  The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested."
50,22.txt,"According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence"
51,22.txt,"since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place."
52,22.txt,"It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above)."
53,22.txt,"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41)."
54,22.txt,"During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above)."
55,22.txt,Mrs Murray testified that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA and about her contacts with them but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence (see paragraph 19 above).
56,22.txt,Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray.
57,22.txt,"This is not perhaps surprising since the trial took place over three years after the events - Mrs Murray having waited eighteen months before bringing her action - and Corporal D., although present, had not taken an active part in the interview (see paragraphs 14, 16, 17 and 21 above)."
58,22.txt,"Corporal D. did however remember that questions had been asked about money and about America and the trial judge found her to be a ""transparently honest witness"" (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above)."
59,22.txt,"Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above)."
60,22.txt,"In the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA."
61,22.txt,"Admittedly, ""there was never any probing examination of her collecting money"" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above)."
62,22.txt,Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).
63,22.txt,The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.
64,22.txt,In the context of the present case this interval cannot be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).
65,22.txt,"They disputed that the impugned measures all formed an integral part of Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention or that the domestic courts had affirmed their lawfulness, in particular as concerns the retention of the records including the photograph of Mrs Murray."
66,22.txt,Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above).
67,22.txt,The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).
68,22.txt,The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above). 
69,22.txt,"The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords also confirmed that the Army’s implied lawful authority under section 14 extended to interrogating a detained person and to recording personal details of the kind contained in the standard record form (see paragraph 41 above and also paragraphs 15, 30 and 34)."
70,22.txt,It is implicit in the judgments of the national courts that the retention of such details was covered by the same lawful authority derived from section 14 (see paragraph 41 in fine above).
71,22.txt,"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above)."
72,22.txt,The impugned measures thus had a basis in domestic law.
73,22.txt,"It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."
74,22.txt,In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime
75,22.txt,A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.
76,22.txt,"The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above)."
77,22.txt,These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes
78,22.txt,The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above).
79,22.txt,"The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above)."
80,22.txt,"The Court accepts that there was in principle a need both for powers of the kind granted by section 14 of the 1978 Act and, in the particular case, to enter and search the home of the Murray family in order to arrest Mrs Murray."
81,22.txt,"Furthermore, the ""conditions of extreme tension"", as Lord Griffiths put it in his speech in the House of Lords, under which such arrests in Northern Ireland have to be carried out must be recognised."
82,22.txt,"The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above):
""The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ... It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned."""
83,22.txt,These are legitimate considerations which go to explain and justify the manner in which the entry into and search of the applicants’ home were carried out.
84,22.txt,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 28, para. 59)."
85,22.txt," (see the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 23, para. 49)."
86,22.txt,Neither can it be regarded as falling outside the legitimate bounds of the process of investigation of terrorist crime for the competent authorities to record and retain basic personal details concerning the arrested person or even other persons present at the time and place of arrest.
87,22.txt,None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above).
88,22.txt,Similar conclusions apply to the taking and retention of a photograph of Mrs Murray at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).
89,22.txt,"The Court does not find that, in relation to any of the applicants, the means employed by the authorities in this regard were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
90,22.txt,"In this connection too, the Court does not find that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
91,22.txt, It was not contested that the impugned measures interfered with the applicants’ exercise of their right to respect for their private and family life and their home.
92,22.txt,"The Court discerns no reason, on the material before it, for not concluding that each of the various measures was ""in accordance with the law"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
93,22.txt, These measures undoubtedly pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.
94,22.txt," In the light of the particular facts of the case, the Court finds that the various measures complained of can be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
95,22.txt,"(see the Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258-B, p. 57, para. 76), which provides:"
96,22.txt,"notably in the Brogan and Others and Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgments (loc. cit., pp. 34-35, para. 65, and pp. 20-21, para. 45, respectively)."
97,22.txt,"  Under the Convention scheme of protection of the right to liberty and security of person, the lex specialis as regards entitlement to a remedy is paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4)"
98,22.txt,"""Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."""
99,22.txt,No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.
100,22.txt,since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.
101,22.txt,Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order.
102,22.txt,"Its effect is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent ""national authority"" both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief in meritorious cases (see, inter alia, the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, para. 122, and the authorities cited there)."
103,22.txt,The remedy available to Mrs Murray would have satisfied these conditions.
104,22.txt,Whether the relevant domestic law as applied to Mrs Murray ensured her a sufficient level of protection of her right to respect for her private life is a substantive issue under Article 8 (art. 8).
105,22.txt,The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).
106,22.txt,Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority
107,22.txt,"(see the James and Others judgment, loc. cit.)."
108,22.txt,"Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the ""co-operative"" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal."
109,22.txt,These circumstances may give rise only to a bona fide suspicion of such complicity.
110,22.txt,"They do not give rise to a ""reasonable"" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence."
111,22.txt,"No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment)."
112,22.txt,"Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest. "
113,22.txt,"From the recorded questions about her brothers or ""about money and about America"", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her ""that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA""."
114,22.txt,"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty."
115,22.txt,"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)""."
116,22.txt,"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case."
117,22.txt,"With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life."
118,22.txt,In the exercise of this power of review the Court must ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by this provision of the Convention has been secured.
119,22.txt,"As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, since Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention were in breach of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), she was entitled to an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with this provision."
120,22.txt,"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5)."
121,22.txt,The alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is directly linked with the issues under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention.
122,22.txt,"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2)."
123,22.txt,"because of the short duration of the detention,"
124,22.txt,"once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means ""that she was suspected of having committed a given offence""."
125,22.txt,"Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow."
126,22.txt,"This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest."
127,22.txt,"This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence."
128,22.txt,"In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because
""it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"",
which induces the Court to come to the conclusion that
""the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview""."
129,22.txt,"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future."
130,22.txt,"In fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand ""the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him""."
131,22.txt, It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).
132,22.txt,"If it is sustained, then it would mean that the guarantee therein contemplated will only come into play in situations such as that which is described in Franz Kafka’s masterpiece The Trial, where the Inspector, who is supposed to interrogate K (the accused person), tells K ,
""I can’t even confirm that you are charged with an offence, or rather I don’t know whether you are."
133,22.txt,"You are under arrest certainly, more than that I do not know."" "
134,22.txt,"English translation by W. and E. Muir from the German original Der Prozess – Penguin reprint 1953, p. 18."
135,22.txt," In the examination of the matter of ""reasonable suspicion"", the key issue seems to me to be whether ""at least some facts or information"" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence."
136,22.txt,In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled.
137,22.txt,"It was suggested by the representative of the Government that ""primary facts"", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from ""something other than the primary facts or information""."
