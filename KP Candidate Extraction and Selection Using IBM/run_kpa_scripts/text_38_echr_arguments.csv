1,38.txt,"They contest that
their claims necessarily raised matters outside the jurisdiction of the
courts in Northern Ireland."
2,38.txt,"Further, they were unable to take
proceedings in Gibraltar since they were not eligible for legal aid and
had no other means of pursuing such proceedings."
3,38.txt,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate
to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can
provide effective and sufficient redress."
4,38.txt,"An applicant does not need
to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach."
5,38.txt,"The Commission has held that where, for example,
there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention must be applied to reflect the practical
realities of the applicant's position in order to ensure the effective
protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (cf.
No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78, and No. 9118/80, Dec.
9.3.83, D.R. 32 p. 159)."
6,38.txt,"Consequently, the Commission finds that the remedy cannot realistically
have been available to the applicants in this case."
7,38.txt,"Further, the Commission finds that the applicants' choice of
pursuing proceedings in the courts of Northern Ireland was not
unreasonable or without basis in domestic law."
8,38.txt,"The applicants in those
proceedings (in respect of which they were granted legal aid by the
relevant domestic authorities) intended, inter alia, to argue that
liability arose out of the actions of Crown agents based in the United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland."
9,38.txt,"The certificates issued by the Secretary
of State were however conclusive of the fact that the alleged liability
did not arise in respect of the Government in the United Kingdom or in
Northern Ireland and effectively put an end to the proceedings."
10,38.txt,"They consider
that Article 2 (Art. 2) imposes a duty on States to adopt clear and
detailed legal rules on the use of lethal force, which strictly control
and limit that use."
11,38.txt,"They consider that United Kingdom law is vague and
general and therefore is in itself in violation of this provision."
12,38.txt," The applicants further submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) should be
interpreted as including a procedural element, namely, the provision
of an effective procedure after a lethal shooting for establishing the
facts."
13,38.txt,"They complain that the Inquest was inadequate, inter alia, as
public interest certificates were used to block crucial evidence."
14,38.txt,"They
allege that there had been a lack of diligence in seeking out witnesses
and attempts made to intimidate and discredit those who did come
forward."
15,38.txt,"They point out that
the jury on consideration of the evidence found that the killings were
lawful."
16,38.txt,"They contend that it is implicit from that finding that the
jury considered that there had been no plot to kill the deceased
terrorists, that the soldiers had honestly and reasonably believed that
there was a car bomb which could be detonated by remote control and
that the degree of force used by the soldiers was proportionate to the
aim of protecting the lives of the people of Gibraltar."
17,38.txt," As regards the Inquest proceedings, the Government submit that
it provided an exhaustive fact-finding investigation by an independent
body."
18,38.txt,"In particular, they highlight the fact that 78 witnesses
(including the S.A.S soldiers and Security Service personnel involved
in the incident) were extensively examined and cross-examined by the
legal representatives of the applicants, that the Inquest was held
within six months of the incident, that the applicants' representatives
made no challenge to the public immunity certificates, and that the
Coroner exercised his discretion to allow certain questions, despite
objection by the Crown on the basis of the certificates."
19,38.txt,"The Commission considers that the applicants' complaints under
Article 2 (Art. 2) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and
law, the determination of which should depend on the merits."
20,38.txt,"(cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27
February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec.
11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102)."
21,38.txt," It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the
existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the
State invoking the rule"
22,38.txt," In the present case, the Commission notes that the applicants,
as conceded by the Government, would not have been eligible for legal
aid in Gibraltar."
23,38.txt,"The Commission finds that they have insufficient
means to pay for legal representation themselves."
24,38.txt,"In this context the
Commission recalls that they were found eligible under the financial
criteria for legal aid in Northern Ireland and before the Commission
itself."
25,38.txt,"Having regard, in addition, to the difficulties imposed by the
distance and the difficulty and complexity of the factual and legal
issues which would have been raised in proceedings in Gibraltar, the
applicants could not have proceeded without legal representation."
26,38.txt,"They
submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) requires, in addition, that States
exercise strict operational control over the use of lethal force,
including the giving of appropriate training, briefings and
instructions."
27,38.txt,"They contend that soldiers are trained to shoot to kill
without warning and that the operation in Gibraltar was neither planned
nor executed in such a way as to minimise the need for the use of
lethal force."
28,38.txt,"They point to the fact that the soldiers were apparently
made to believe (wrongly)"

bomb could be detonated by the suspects by means of a remote control
device."
