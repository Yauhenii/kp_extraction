of domestic remedies under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention is
that, before proceedings are brought in an international court, the
state made answerable must have had an opportunity to redress the
alleged damage by domestic means within the framework of its own legal
system (cf. No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57)."
