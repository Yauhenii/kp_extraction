3,37.txt,"The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27
para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention."
4,37.txt,"It considers that the
term ""another procedure"" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention."
5,37.txt,"Moreover, the
term ""international investigation or settlement"" refers to institutions
and procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental
bodies.

6,37.txt,"The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union
constitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para.
1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and
procedures. "
7,37.txt,"Reference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's
passport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992
prohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the
Public Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant
from seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention
up to 7 September 1992."
8,37.txt," The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from
7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the
Commission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention
to receive individual petitions."
9,37.txt," On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to
the period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared
inadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions
of the Convention."
10,37.txt,"However, the applicant's various complaints raise
different issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione
temporis."
11,37.txt," It is
submitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission
on 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date
on which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the
applicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been
exhausted."

only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been
exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international
law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final
decision was taken""."
13,37.txt,"The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort
dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992."
14,37.txt,"The applicant then
filed his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992."
15,37.txt,"On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further
appeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a
complaint with the Prosecutor General."
16,37.txt,"The applicant filed an appeal
with the Prosecutor General which the latter dismissed on 11 November
1992. "
17,37.txt,"Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the
applicant submitted his application form to the Commission.
"
18,37.txt," The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also
complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention."
19,37.txt,"The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating
to a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force
of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione
temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of
Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.

20,37.txt,"   In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the
final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e.
before 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the
Convention in respect of Bulgaria."
21,37.txt,"After the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed
a request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor
General dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no
new circumstances justifying modification of detention."
22,37.txt,"In his view,
confirmation herefor can be seen in the decision of 12 August 1992
which banned meetings between the applicant and his lawyers, thereby
indicating that the true purpose of his detention was to restrict his
right actively and freely to express his political views as a member
of the National Assembly."
23,37.txt," The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries
is not an offence under Bulgarian law. "
24,37.txt,"However, this is not the
correct formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were
brought against the applicant and other persons."
25,37.txt,"The Government also refer in this context to the Convention
organs' case-law, in particular the Bozano case, according to which,
where the Convention refers back to domestic law as in Article 5
para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c), the Convention organs' supervisory powers are
limited since it is in the first place for the national authorities,
notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Eur. Court
H.R., judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 58)."
26,37.txt," The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no
other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in
Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention."
27,37.txt," He complains in particular that
the authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of
various medical experts;  as a result, his health seriously
deteriorated."
28,37.txt,"For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had
worse basic indicators of his blood count."
29,37.txt,"Twice he had to undergo
treatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital."
30,37.txt,"He was sent to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital despite the danger of
infections posing a risk to his health and life.

31,37.txt,"The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to
Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention."
32,37.txt,"The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date
on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria,
medical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and
28 August 1992."
33,37.txt,"Thereafter, further reports were issued on 16 September 1992 and
on 2 October 1992."
34,37.txt,"These reports were prepared by numerous medical
experts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist."
35,37.txt,"It transpires
from these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic
lympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart."
36,37.txt,"While
the applicant had apparently suffered from angina pectoris, there was
no sign of a myocardial infarct."

Convention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him."
38,37.txt,"On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention
entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was
transferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National
Investigation Service."
39,37.txt," However, following a deterioration of his
cardiovascular condition on 10 and 11 September 1992, he was taken to
the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute."
40,37.txt," In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the
applicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital
environment."
41,37.txt,"The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain
medication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical
supervision at a hospital."
42,37.txt,"As a result, the applicant remained at the
Higher Military Medical Institute until 30 November 1992 when he
returned to the National Investigation Service."
43,37.txt,"A week later, when his
health deteriorated, he was again taken to the Higher Military Medical
Institute."
44,37.txt,"On 30 December 1992 he was released from detention.
"
45,37.txt," The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was
monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their
recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required
medical treatment."
46,37.txt,"Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his
detention was spent in hospital."
47,37.txt,"At one stage he was even brought to
the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute."
48,37.txt,"Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter
alia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was
brought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious
diseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with
any particular illness while in hospital."
49,37.txt,"They continuously reviewed the
detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's
health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.

applicant's state of ill-health."

Convention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on
13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons
being present."
52,37.txt,"However, the fact complained of relates to a period
prior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
53,37.txt,"  The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the
applicant have not yet been terminated. "
54,37.txt,"He has not, therefore, been
""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1
(Art. 7-1) of the Convention."
55,37.txt," The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a
violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention."
56,37.txt,"The
applicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order
of 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article
published on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written
materials to his lawyers."
57,37.txt,"The prohibition was renewed in November
1992."
58,37.txt,"The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully
carried into effect until the end of August and in early September
1992."
59,37.txt,"In fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's
contacts with his lawyers."
60,37.txt," While in detention the applicant wrote
altogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared
after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
61,37.txt,"He also wrote a book which was published
after his release."
62,37.txt,"The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this
prohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992."
63,37.txt," In
the Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently
established any interferences with his right to freedom of expression
after 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of
the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.

65,37.txt,"Indeed, when preparing their reports,
the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health
of the years 1988-1990."
66,37.txt,"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international
investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1
(b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention."
