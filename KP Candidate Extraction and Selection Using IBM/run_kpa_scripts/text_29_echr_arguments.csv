1,29.txt,Even though they own the fourth applicant company no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward.
2,29.txt,In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.
3,29.txt,"The extensive publicity
 
after the report's publication was ephemeral."
4,29.txt,"Whilst it is true that
an action in defamation against these public officials would probably
have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely
reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic
law, rather than the right of access to court for determining the
applicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the
Convention."
5,29.txt,"The Government have contended that the applicants could
have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly
proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for
them, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by
them during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in
respect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report."
6,29.txt,"The
Government have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury

trial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore

had to withdrew the defamation proceedings against The Observer."
7,29.txt,They have contended that the report could not be used as evidence in those proceedings.
8,29.txt,"The Government emphasised that the decision of the Secretary of State to publish the report was not a decision directed against the applicants; it was a decision taken in the general public interest, including that of freedom of expression and information, having regard to the overall content of the report."
9,29.txt,The Commission considers that this part of the application raises a serious question of fact and law which is of such complexity that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits.
10,29.txt,"Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, cited above, guarantees a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges. "
11,29.txt,"Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) provides that anyone ""charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law""."
12,29.txt,"The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation."
13,29.txt,"They had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth

applicant's affairs, and, in particular the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985."
14,29.txt,Before the Inspectors' report was published it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants.
15,29.txt,The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants. 
16,29.txt,"They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence."
17,29.txt,"The Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution"
18,29.txt,"(cf. the Court's aforementioned Deweer judgment of 27 February 1990, p. 24, para. 46, and the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, p. 15, para. 30)."
19,29.txt,"However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been ""charged"" any longer."
20,29.txt,The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements. 
21,29.txt,"The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs."
22,29.txt,"The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation."
23,29.txt,"In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras.

1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed."
24,29.txt,"Everyone has the right to respect for his private
... life ...

2.	There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."""
25,29.txt,"The applicants have submitted, inter alia, that English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case. The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation."
26,29.txt,"Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information."
27,29.txt,"Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this."
28,29.txt,The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all.
29,29.txt,"Nor was there any need to protect others' right such as those of Lonrho, by publishing the report in its entirety, as their rights were adequately secured by the ordinary courts."
30,29.txt,"The Government have contended, inter alia, that the report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants."
31,29.txt,They stated that the applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage.
32,29.txt,The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen. 
33,29.txt,"The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy (cf. the Inspectors' report paras. 16.2.5

and 16.6.2, pp. 5-6 above)."
34,29.txt,"Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above)"
35,29.txt,"States enjoy a margin of appreciation in their decision whether to publish reports of the present kind, provided that the decision is not taken arbitrarily or with malice towards the particular individuals involved. "
36,29.txt,"The question is one of proportionality or balance between the public and the individual interests.
"
37,29.txt,The Commission finds that no elements of arbitrariness are disclosed in the present case.
38,29.txt,"Although it might be fair to say that no investigation into the applicants' affairs would have been started if Lonrho had not launched its campaign against them, the actual investigation by the Inspectors and their report indicate no malice or unreasonableness."
39,29.txt,"As a whole the report may be said to be balanced and thorough; it is not a one-sided condemnation of the applicants and

gives them credit where credit is due for their business activities."
40,29.txt,"The investigation of certain aspects of their private lives was necessary in view of their claims about their personal backgrounds, which they themselves had vaunted through the media, and as a result of which they had enjoyed a good business reputation for quite some time; hence their success in the HOF takeover bid."
41,29.txt,"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to

the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
42,29.txt,"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
43,29.txt,The applicants have alleged that the publication of the report constituted a measure of control of the use of their property.
44,29.txt,"It seriously damaged their reputation and financial standing and, thereby, harmed their economic interests in the business of HOF. "
45,29.txt,Restrictions were put on their management of Harrods Bank.
46,29.txt,The restrictions placed on Harrods Bank were made by the Bank of England and were not caused by the publication of the report.
47,29.txt,"If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the

ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions."
48,29.txt,No evidence of any significant economic prejudice has been submitted to it.
49,29.txt,"Insofar as certain management restrictions were placed on Harrods Bank by the Bank of England one month after publication of the report, the Commission notes that the applicants had a right of appeal to an independent tribunal which does not appear to have been tried

(pp. 14-15 above)."
50,29.txt,In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case.
51,29.txt," Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows:

""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this
Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy
before a national authority notwithstanding that the
violation has been committed by persons acting in an
official capacity."""
52,29.txt,Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.
53,29.txt,"However, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention."
54,29.txt,"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention"
55,29.txt,"The Commission has found above that the applicants' claims under Article 6 paras. 1 (criminal) and 2, Article 8 (Art. 6-1, 6-2,

8)	of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
56,29.txt,"In the light of the reasons

upon which those findings are based, the Commission also considers that the facts of the present case fail to disclose an ""arguable claim"" of

a violation of these provisions."
57,29.txt,"To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
58,29.txt,"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention"
59,29.txt,"because of the great breadth of the Secretary of State's and the
Inspectors' discretionary powers"
60,29.txt,"the restrictive scope of judicial
review"
61,29.txt," impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary
of State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had
a defence of absolute or qualified privilege."
62,29.txt,The applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct.
63,29.txt,"However, Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual

is guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6

(Art. 6)"
64,29.txt,"(cf. eg. Eur. Court H.R., Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982,

Series A No. 49; Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35; and No. 7986/77, Krause v. Switzerland, Dec. 3.10.78, D.R. 13 p. 73)."
65,29.txt," Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the
 
applicants at all stages of the contents of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit. "
66,29.txt,Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids.
67,29.txt,Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future.
68,29.txt,"It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded."
69,29.txt,Moreover the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose.
70,29.txt,It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF (p. 7 above).
71,29.txt,The Commission finds that the publication of the Inspectors' report with certain of its findings constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.
72,29.txt,"However, that interference was in accordance with the law, the publication being authorised by section 437 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 1985. "
73,29.txt,Investigations into large scale commercial activities of the present kind and the need to ensure honest dealings fall within the notion of protecting the economic well-being of the country.
74,29.txt,The interest of the general public in being informed about matters of major public concern can best be served by the publication of the results of Government inquiries.
75,29.txt,Further elements of general interest are cited above at pp. 9 and 13.
76,29.txt,The needs of democracy justify transparency in such matters.
77,29.txt,"""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful
enjoyment of his possessions.	No one shall be deprived of
his possessions except in the public interest and subject
to the conditions provided for by law and by the general
principles of international law.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way
impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems
necessary to control the use of property in accordance with
the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or
other contributions or penalties."""
78,29.txt,"Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about

the acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest."
