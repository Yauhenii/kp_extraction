1,08.txt," The Government contended that the rule relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies was clearly established in international law and in the case-law of the Convention organs,"
2,08.txt,"In fact, Mr Aksoy could have had recourse to three different types of domestic remedy: a criminal prosecution, a civil action and/or administrative proceedings (see paragraphs 24-28 above)."
3,08.txt, required the applicant to avail himself of all national remedies unless these clearly offered him no chance of success. 
4,08.txt,"With regard to the first of these options, they submitted that he could have complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the public prosecutor who saw him on 10 December 1992 (see paragraph 18 above)."
5,08.txt,"Articles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code, which were in force throughout Turkey, penalised the use of torture and ill-treatment for the extraction of confessions (see paragraph 24 above)."
6,08.txt,Legislative Decree no. 285 on the state of emergency region transferred the power to carry out investigations into criminal acts allegedly committed by civil servants from the public prosecutors to the administrative councils (see paragraph 26 above).
7,08.txt,"However, decisions by the administrative councils not to prosecute were always reviewed by the Supreme Administrative Court."
8,08.txt,They therefore drew the Court’s attention to the existence of an administrative remedy under Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution (see paragraph 27 above).
9,08.txt,"In order to receive compensation under this provision, an individual needed only to show that there was a causal link between the acts committed by the administration and the wrong suffered; there was no requirement to prove serious misconduct on the part of a government agent."
10,08.txt,"In this connection, the Government submitted examples of administrative decisions in which compensation had been awarded in respect of death caused by torture in police custody."
11,08.txt,"  In addition, the Government argued that Mr Aksoy could have brought a civil action for damages."
12,08.txt,"Again, they referred to a number of decisions of the domestic courts, including a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a case concerning a claim for damages for torture, where it was held that offences committed by members of the security forces were governed by the Code of Obligations and that, under Article 53 of that Code, an acquittal for lack of evidence in criminal proceedings was not binding on the civil courts."
13,08.txt,"In particular, he argued that reports by a number of international bodies showing that the torture of detainees continued to be systematic and widespread in Turkey raised questions about the commitment of the State to bringing an end to this practice."
14,08.txt,In this respect he referred to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s Public Statement on Turkey (15 December 1992); the United Nations Committee against Torture’s Summary Account of the Results of the Proceedings Concerning the Inquiry on Turkey (9 November 1993); and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture’s Report of 1995 
15,08.txt,"Furthermore, lawyers and others who acted for the victims of human rights violations were subjected to threats, intimidation and abusive prosecutions and individuals were afraid to pursue domestic remedies because reprisals against complainants were so common."
16,08.txt,"In these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he should not be required to pursue domestic remedies before making a complaint to Strasbourg."
17,08.txt," In any case, he maintained that he had informed the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992 that he had been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and asserted that, even if he had not, the prosecutor could plainly have observed that he did not have the proper use of his hands."
18,08.txt,The failure of the prosecutor to start a criminal investigation made it extremely difficult for the applicant to avail himself of any domestic remedy.
19,08.txt,"It followed that, although it was not possible to establish exactly what happened during his meeting with the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992, there must undoubtedly have been elements which should have prompted the latter to open an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information about the applicant’s state of health and the treatment to which he had been subjected."
20,08.txt," In addition, this failure prejudiced his chances of victory in civil or administrative proceedings, because in order to succeed with either type of claim it would have been necessary to prove that he had suffered torture, and in practice a ruling to that effect by a judge in criminal proceedings would have been required."
21,08.txt," Finally, he reminded the Court that no remedy was available even in theory in relation to his complaint regarding the length of time he was detained without judicial control, since this was perfectly lawful under the domestic legislation (see paragraph 29 above)."
22,08.txt, The Commission was of the opinion that the applicant had been injured during his time in police custody (see paragraph 23 above).
23,08.txt,"Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. "
24,08.txt,"Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism."
25,08.txt," These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State."
26,08.txt,"In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65)."
27,08.txt,The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system.
28,08.txt,"The Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of ill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting."
29,08.txt,"However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in Turkish law he was under a duty to investigate (see paragraph 26 above)."
30,08.txt,It must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police custody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support.
31,08.txt,During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment (see paragraph 23 above).
32,08.txt,"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State."
33,08.txt,"For example, they questioned why the applicant had made no complaint to the public prosecutor about having been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and found it difficult to understand why, if he had indeed been subjected to torture, he had not made any inculpatory confession."
34,08.txt,They also found it suspicious that he had waited for five days between being released from police custody and contacting the hospital (see paragraph 19 above) and observed that it could not be assumed that nothing untoward had occurred in the meantime.
35,08.txt,"Finally, they raised a number of points relating to the medical evidence, including the facts that the applicant took his medical records with him when he left hospital and that there was no medical evidence of burns or other marks left by the application of electric shocks."
36,08.txt," The Court considers, in the light of all the material before it, that the particular extent and impact of PKK terrorist activity in South-East Turkey has undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a ""public emergency threatening the life of the nation"" "
37,08.txt,"It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of ""promptness""."
38,08.txt," Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable."
39,08.txt,"The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:
""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...
...
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ..."""

41,08.txt," The Court recalls its decision in the case of Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, p. 33, para. 62), that a period of detention without judicial control of four days and six hours fell outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3)."
42,08.txt," By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of the derogations necessary to avert it."
43,08.txt,"Nonetheless, Contracting Parties do not enjoy an unlimited discretion."
44,08.txt,"It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, the States have gone beyond the ""extent strictly required by the exigencies"" of the crisis."
45,08.txt,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, p. 56, para. 28, the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 78, para. 205, and the above-mentioned Brannigan and McBride judgment, p. 50, para. 47)."
46,08.txt,"The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty."
47,08.txt,"Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law "
48,08.txt,"(see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, p. 32, para. 58). "
49,08.txt," In the Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68 above), the Court held that the United Kingdom Government had not exceeded their margin of appreciation by derogating from their obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) to the extent that individuals suspected of terrorist offences were allowed to be held for up to seven days without judicial control."
50,08.txt,"Furthermore, prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of serious ill treatment, which, as stated above (paragraph 62), is prohibited by the Convention in absolute and non-derogable terms."
51,08.txt,who was detained over a long period of time.
52,08.txt,"In particular, the denial of access to a lawyer, doctor, relative or friend and the absence of any realistic possibility of being brought before a court to test the legality of the detention meant that he was left completely at the mercy of those holding him."
53,08.txt," the Court considers that in this case insufficient safeguards were available to the applicant,"
54,08.txt," Accordingly, in view in particular of the lack of any investigation, the Court finds that the applicant was denied an effective remedy in respect of his allegation of torture."
55,08.txt," In the Court’s view, against this background, it is more appropriate to consider this complaint in relation to the more general obligation on States under Article 13 (art. 13) to provide an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention.
2. Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13)"
56,08.txt,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 (art. 13) must be ""effective"" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State."
57,08.txt,"Indeed, under Turkish law the prosecutor was under a duty to carry out an investigation."
58,08.txt,"The Court recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) embodies the ""right to a court"", of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, for example, the Holy Monasteries v. Greece judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 36-37, para. 80)."
59,08.txt,"There can be no doubt that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applies to a civil claim for compensation in respect of ill treatment allegedly committed by agents of the State (see, for example, the Tomasi judgment cited at paragraph 61 above, p. 43, paras. 121-22)."
60,08.txt,"The Court recalls, however, that because of the special circumstances which existed in his case (see paragraph 57 above), Mr Aksoy did not even attempt to make an application before the civil courts."
61,08.txt,"(see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1219, para. 105)."
62,08.txt, The Court reiterates that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) that applicants or potential applicants are able to communicate freely with the Commission without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints
63,08.txt,"That being so, in the present case the Commission was unable to find any evidence to show that Mr Aksoy’s death was connected with his application, or that the State authorities had been responsible for any interference, in the form of threats or intimidation, with his rights under Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1), and no new evidence in this connection was presented to the Court."
64,08.txt,"The respondent Government, both in that case and the present case, submitted to the Commission in the first place and later to the European Court - both in their memorial and at the public hearing - dozens of judgments of the courts of first instance or the supreme courts such as the Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court.
7.   Most of these judgments concerned cases in south-eastern Turkey where acts of terrorism are being committed and where the present case occurred. The following examples give a brief summary of some of these decisions."
65,08.txt,"I consider that ""where there is doubt"", and especially where there is doubt, domestic remedies must be exhausted as required by the Commission (decision of 14 March 1985, Garcia v. Switzerland, application no. 10148/82, Decisions and Reports 42, p. 98). And the applicant did nothing of the sort."
66,08.txt,"The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67)."
67,08.txt, The Court emphasises that its approach to the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. 
68,08.txt,"(see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67)."
69,08.txt,He referred to medical evidence from Dicle University Medical Faculty which showed that he was suffering from a bilateral brachial plexus injury at the time of his admission to hospital (see paragraph 19 above).
70,08.txt,"This injury was consistent with Palestinian hanging.
"
71,08.txt," He claimed to have been kept blindfolded during interrogation, which caused disorientation; to have been suspended from his arms, which were tied together behind his back (""Palestinian hanging""); to have been given electric shocks, which were exacerbated by throwing water over him; and to have been subjected to beatings, slapping and verbal abuse."
72,08.txt,He submitted that the treatment complained of was sufficiently severe as to amount to torture; it was inflicted with the purpose of inducing him to admit that he knew the man who had identified him.
73,08.txt,"In addition, he contended that the conditions in which he was detained (see paragraph 13 above) and the constant fear of torture which he suffered while in custody amounted to inhuman treatment."
74,08.txt,"Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
75,08.txt,"In order to determine whether any particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction drawn in Article 3 (art. 3) between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment."
76,08.txt,"The Court recalls that the Commission found, inter alia, that the applicant was subjected to ""Palestinian hanging"", in other words, that he was stripped naked, with his arms tied together behind his back, and suspended by his arms (see paragraph 23 above).
In the view of the Court this treatment could only have been deliberately inflicted; indeed, a certain amount of preparation and exertion would have been required to carry it out."
77,08.txt, It would appear to have been administered with the aim of obtaining admissions or information from the applicant.
78,08.txt," In addition to the severe pain which it must have caused at the time, the medical evidence shows that it led to a paralysis of both arms which lasted for some time (see paragraph 23 above)."
79,08.txt,"Article 3 (art. 3), as the Court has observed on many occasions, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society."
80,08.txt,The Court considers that this treatment was of such a serious and cruel nature that it can only be described as torture.
81,08.txt," In addition, according to the ""generally recognised rules of international law"" to which Article 26 (art. 26) makes reference, there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal."
82,08.txt,"(see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65)."
83,08.txt,"The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law."
84,08.txt,"He stated that there was a policy on the part of the State authorities of denying that torture ever took place, which made it extremely difficult for victims to succeed in receiving compensation and in having those responsible brought to justice."
85,08.txt,"For example, it was now impossible for individuals alleging torture to obtain medical reports proving the extent of their injuries, because the forensic medical service had been reorganised and doctors who issued such reports were either threatened or moved to a different area."
86,08.txt,Prosecutors in the state of emergency region routinely failed to open investigations into alleged abuses of human rights and frequently refused even to acknowledge complaints.
87,08.txt,Such investigations as were carried out were biased and inadequate.
