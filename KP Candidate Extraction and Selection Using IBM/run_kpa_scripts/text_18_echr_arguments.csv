1,18.txt,"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention""."
2,18.txt,"The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that ""[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred"" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression."
3,18.txt,"In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968)."
4,18.txt,"The applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views."
5,18.txt,"The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia."
6,18.txt,"The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure."
7,18.txt,"The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths. "
8,18.txt,"Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the ""reputation or rights of others""."
9,18.txt,since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable.
10,18.txt,The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal.
11,18.txt,Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.
12,18.txt,"Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme."
13,18.txt,It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value.
14,18.txt,"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,"
15,18.txt,"since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining."
16,18.txt,The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences
17,18.txt,"it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated."
18,18.txt,"It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time."
19,18.txt,"Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965."
20,18.txt,"(see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57)."
21,18.txt,"Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
22,18.txt, The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements.
23,18.txt,He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions. 
24,18.txt,"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above)."
25,18.txt,"The Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2)."
26,18.txt,"On the other hand, as to the contents of the Greenjackets item, it should be noted that the TV presenter’s introduction started by a reference to recent public discussion and press comments on racism in Denmark, thus inviting the viewer to see the programme in that context."
27,18.txt,"He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background."
28,18.txt,There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim.
29,18.txt,"Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
30,18.txt,"On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern."
31,18.txt,The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).
32,18.txt,"However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it."
33,18.txt," Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above)."
34,18.txt,"The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed."
35,18.txt,"Both the TV presenter’s introduction and the applicant’s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of ""a group of extremist youths"" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them."
36,18.txt,The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs.
37,18.txt,"It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets."
38,18.txt,"Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race."
39,18.txt,"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,"
40,18.txt,"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest."
41,18.txt,Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.
42,18.txt,"Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (ibid.)."
43,18.txt,We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.
44,18.txt,"A journalist’s good intentions are not enough in such a situation, especially in a case in which he has himself provoked the racist statements."
45,18.txt,The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination probably does not require the punishment of journalists responsible for a television spot of this kind.
46,18.txt,"On the other hand, it supports the opinion that the media too can be obliged to take a clear stand in the area of racial discrimination and hatred."
47,18.txt,"The threat of racial discrimination and persecution is certainly serious in our society, and the Court has rightly emphasised the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations (paragraph 30 of the judgment)."
48,18.txt,"The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant."
49,18.txt,"The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court."
50,18.txt,the applicant’s conviction being based on Articles 266 (b) and 23 (1) of the Penal Code.
51,18.txt,"In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention."
52,18.txt,"The Government’s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above)."
53,18.txt,"In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention."
