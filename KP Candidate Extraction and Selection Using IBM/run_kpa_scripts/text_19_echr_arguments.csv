1,19.txt,They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions.
2,19.txt,They were not proceedings brought by one of the parties or by a complainant.
3,19.txt,hey constituted a sui generis procedure aimed at securing the unimpeded functioning of the courts and safeguarding the authority of the judiciary.
4,19.txt,The proceedings were not adversarial in the sense that one person was opposed to another; they concerned the integrity of the judicial system.
5,19.txt,No single judge had any interest in them.
6,19.txt,The long-established power granted to common-law courts to sanction improper conduct committed in their face was a necessary and indispensable element of a fair trial itself.
7,19.txt,The Assize Court’s own duty to ensure a fair trial of the persons accused of murder in the present case required it to possess the summary power to deal with any contempt before it.
8,19.txt,"The Government further maintained that, in order to be effective, the judicial power to sanction attempts by any person in the courtroom to dominate the court and determine the course of the trial had to be exercised immediately."
9,19.txt,Otherwise the person in contempt would in effect have achieved his purpose.
10,19.txt,"Moreover, if contempt proceedings had been brought before a different bench, there would have been certain undesirable consequences that could not have been overlooked: the members of the bench would have had to testify about the events which had taken place before their eyes."
11,19.txt,Their credibility in connection with the facts of which they had become aware while performing their functions would have had to have been tested by other judges and the very integrity of the judiciary would accordingly have been unnecessarily questioned.
12,19.txt," According to the Government, the applicant would have been entitled to allege a breach of the impartiality rule only on the (incorrect) assumption that the Assize Court had been acting in a personal capacity in trying him."
13,19.txt,"Furthermore, the fact that the applicant had been able to appeal to the Supreme Court, a judicial body with full jurisdiction to review facts and law, cured any possible breach of the impartiality requirement."
14,19.txt,"The Supreme Court had independently found that the applicant had been guilty of the offence of contempt, and had upheld the sentence imposed by the Assize Court."
15,19.txt,"Applying the criteria established by the case-law of the Court (see Engel and others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, §§ 82-83; Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, §§ 48-50), namely a)"
16,19.txt,"the domestic classification of the offence, b) the nature of the offence, and c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring,"
17,19.txt,"The offence was classified in domestic law as criminal, it was not confined to the applicant’s status as a lawyer, the maximum possible sentence was one month’s imprisonment and the sentence actually imposed on the applicant was 5 days’ imprisonment"
18,19.txt,"(see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, §§ 82-86, ECHR 2003-X)."
19,19.txt, The Court considers that the decisive feature of the case is that the judges of the court which convicted the applicant were the same judges before whom the contempt was allegedly committed.
20,19.txt,"The Government’s assertion that the judges who convicted the applicant cannot be considered complainants in the proceedings and had no personal interest in the relevant offence but were simply defending the authority and standing of the court is, in the opinion of the Court, theoretical."
21,19.txt,The reality is that courts are not impersonal institutions but function through the judges who compose them.
22,19.txt,It is the judges who interpret a certain act or type of conduct as contempt of court.
23,19.txt,"Whether a contempt has been committed must be assessed on the basis of the particular judges’ own personal understanding, feelings, sense of dignity and standards of behaviour."
24,19.txt,Justice is offended if the judges feel that it has been.
25,19.txt,Their personal feelings are brought to bear in the process of judging whether there has been a contempt of court.
26,19.txt,Their own perception and evaluation of the facts and their own judgment are engaged in this process.
27,19.txt,The Court endorses in this respect the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Offutt v. USA (348 U.S. 11. 75 S.Ct.11):
28,19.txt,"“But judges also are human, and may, in a human way, quite unwittingly identify offence to self with obstruction to law. "
29,19.txt,"Accordingly, this Court has deemed it important that district judges guard against this easy confusion by not sitting themselves in judgment upon misconduct of counsel where the contempt charged is entangled with the judge’s personal feeling against the lawyer”."
30,19.txt," In this connection, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court acknowledged that as “persons” they were “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns, and emphasised the importance for them of upholding the authority and integrity of justice."
31,19.txt,"In fact, with the exception of Cyprus, this is the practice in the High Contracting Parties to the Convention as regards behaviour which constitutes the criminal offence of contempt of court."
32,19.txt,"The situation regarding sanctions of a disciplinary nature, in the form of fines, imposed for behaviour which does not attract criminal liability, is different (Ravnsborg v. Sweden, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283‑B)."
33,19.txt,"As regards the applicant’s contention concerning the subjective bias of the judges of the Assize Court, the Court notes that the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the Court’s case-law (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58)."
34,19.txt,The personal impartiality of each judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid.).
35,19.txt,"This was triggered, to some extent, by the court’s interpretation of the word “ravasakia” as “love letters” instead of “notes” although that word has two possible different meanings (see § 23 above), the particular context in which it was used and the applicant’s statement that he saw:
“with [his] own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to an other when [he] was cross-examining ...”."
36,19.txt," In this respect, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court stated that the applicant “did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to an exchange of ""ravasakia"", that is, ""love letters""” and acknowledged that as “persons” they had been “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns."
37,19.txt,"The lack of impartiality is evidenced by the intemperate reaction of the judges to the conduct of the applicant, as evidenced by their haste to try him summarily for the criminal offence of contempt of court without availing themselves of other alternative, less drastic, measures such as a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, refusing to hear the applicant unless he withdrew his statements, or asking him to leave the courtroom."
38,19.txt,"“If the Court’s reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow (καταστροφικό)”."
39,19.txt,The Court also finds relevant in this connection its observations and conclusions below regarding the complaints of breach of the presumption of innocence and insufficient information as to the nature and cause of the change against the applicant (paragraphs 52-58 and 65-68).
40,19.txt," In this respect an additional important factor is the harsh punishment - immediate imprisonment - which they imposed on the applicant while stating, for example:
i) “We cannot conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person...”"
41,19.txt," According to the Court’s case-law, it is possible for a higher tribunal, in certain circumstances, to make reparation for an initial violation of the Convention"
42,19.txt,"(see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 19, § 33)."
43,19.txt,"However, in the present case, the Court observes that the Supreme Court agreed with the approach of the first instance court, i.e. that the latter could itself try a case of criminal contempt committed in its face, and rejected the applicant’s complaints which are now before this Court."
44,19.txt,There was no retrial of the case by the Supreme Court.
45,19.txt,"As a court of appeal, the Supreme Court did not have full competence to deal de novo with the case, but could only review the first instance judgment for possible legal or manifest factual errors."
46,19.txt,"It did not carry out an ab initio, independent determination of the criminal charge against the applicant for contempt of the Assize Court."
47,19.txt,"Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that it could not interfere with the judgment of the Assize Court, accepting that that court had a margin of appreciation in imposing a sentence on the applicant."
48,19.txt,"Indeed, although the Supreme Court had the power to quash the impugned decision on the ground that the composition of the Assize Court had not been such as to guarantee its impartiality, it declined to do so."
49,19.txt, The Court also notes that the appeal did not have a suspensive effect on the judgment of the Assize Court.
50,19.txt,"In this connection, it observes that the applicant’s conviction and sentence became effective under domestic criminal procedure on the same day as the delivery of the judgment by the Assize Court, i.e. on 14 February 2001."
51,19.txt,"The applicant filed his appeal the next day, on 15 February 2001, whilst he was serving the five-day sentence of imprisonment."
52,19.txt,"The decision on appeal was delivered on 2 April 2001, long after the sentence had been served."
53,19.txt," In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that any defect in the proceedings of the Assize Court was cured on appeal by the Supreme Court."
54,19.txt,"The Court accepts that the facts, as disclosed by the minutes of the relevant proceedings and the final decision of the Assize Court, reveal that a degree of personal partiality did indeed emerge on the part of the judges during their discussion with the applicant."
55,19.txt,"In conclusion, the Court considers that there has been a breach of the principle of impartiality, on the basis of both the objective and subjective tests."
56,19.txt,"The judges had applied the presumption automatically in their decision-making process, but the facts before them had been such as to rebut that presumption."
57,19.txt,"All judges were imbued with the necessity of upholding the presumption of innocence, and automatically applied it without having to state expressly in every case that they had done so."
58,19.txt,"The fact that the court had stated that what had been said prima facie constituted contempt, and invited representations on the matter, could not be considered a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention."
59,19.txt,"If the applicant had produced a good explanation for what he had said, he would not have been found in contempt."
60,19.txt,It was totally unrealistic to suggest that the court had closed its mind to this possibility.
61,19.txt,The presumption of innocence required the court to refrain from taking any decision as to the applicant’s guilt until all parties had had an opportunity to make representations.
62,19.txt,"It was clear that the court had made up its mind as to his guilt immediately, and all he had been offered was an opportunity to enter a plea in mitigation as to sentence."
63,19.txt,"That was clear from the Assize Court’s judgment, where it was stated “Later, after a long break, Mr Kyprianou was given a second chance to say something to the Court, in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour”."
64,19.txt,The Court recalls that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention is one of the constituent elements of a fair criminal trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1.
65,19.txt," In the present case the Court notes, on the basis of the minutes of the relevant proceedings, that the Assize Court formed and expressed an opinion during its discussion with the applicant amounting to a conclusion that it considered him guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court."
66,19.txt,"In particular, following the court’s refusal to grant him leave to withdraw from the case and his statement regarding the exchange of “ravasakia” between the judges, the court stated the following:"
67,19.txt,“We consider that what has just been said by Mr Kyprianou and in particular the manner with which he addresses to the Court constitutes a contempt of court and Mr Kyprianou has two choices: either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him or for him to decide whether he should retract.
68,19.txt,We give him this opportunity exceptionally. 
69,19.txt,Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law applies to its full extent”.
70,19.txt,"In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant was given little opportunity to react to the possibility of such a finding or put forward his own explanations and representations in this respect."
71,19.txt,"Furthermore, following the applicant’s persistence and a second short break, the court reaffirmed its view by stating that:"
72,19.txt,"“We continue to believe that what Mr Kyprianou said, the content, the manner and the tone of his voice, constitute a contempt of Court as provided in Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law 14/60”."
73,19.txt,"The Court agrees with the applicant that, essentially, he was asked for mitigation rather than given a full opportunity to defend himself against a charge which would have grave consequences for his liberty."
74,19.txt,"In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Assize Court violated the principle of the presumption of innocence."
75,19.txt,"The Court recalls that the fairness of proceedings must be assessed with regard to the case as a whole (see, for example, Miailhe v. France (No. 2), judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports 1996‑IV, p. 1338, § 43, and Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, pp. 13-14, § 38)."
76,19.txt,Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention underlines the need for special attention to be paid to informing the defendant of the “accusation”.
77,19.txt,"It affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the “cause” of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts."
78,19.txt,"That information should be detailed (see Pélissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, § 51, ECHR 1999‑II)."
79,19.txt,The scope of this provision must be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
80,19.txt," In the present case, the Court observes that the applicant was informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him by the Assize Court after the court had already formed the view that the applicant was guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court (see §§ 53‑56 above)."
81,19.txt,"Furthermore, the material facts which influenced the court’s decision, as expressed in the decision of the majority to impose a prison sentence on him, were not disclosed before that decision."
82,19.txt,"These facts were, first, that the Assize Court interpreted the word “ravasakia” to mean “love letters” rather than “notes”; secondly, the court’s objections regarding the applicant’s tone of voice and his gestures to the court which had created “a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court”; and thirdly, the Assize Court’s view that the applicant had accused the court of restricting him and of “doing justice in secret”."
83,19.txt,The Court reiterates it findings concerning the review by the Supreme Court (§§ 43-46 above) and the failure to remedy the defects in the proceedings of the Assize Court on appeal.
84,19.txt," The applicant submitted that his case had received extensive publicity in Cyprus and abroad, something which had caused him severe stress, mental suffering and aggravation."
85,19.txt,"He maintained that the wide and adverse media coverage over a number of months had affected his own and his family’s life and reputation, as well as his professional and political career."
86,19.txt,"In the latter connection, he referred to the fact that he had withdrawn his candidacy for membership of parliament in the 2001 elections, due to the embarrassment which he felt."
87,19.txt,"The applicant argued that he had been humiliated and treated like a common criminal despite the fact that he had been a law-abiding citizen, a member of parliament and an advocate for about 40 years, with an unblemished record."
88,19.txt,He was not a convicted prisoner or guilty of such undeserving conduct as to justify a refusal of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention; he had simply been defending his client in a murder trial.
89,19.txt,He emphasised that his complaint was not that the events caused his condition but that they had contributed to its deterioration.
90,19.txt,He pointed out that diabetics required special medical attention on a daily basis which he had not received during the five days spent in prison.
91,19.txt,"He claimed that, following his imprisonment, he had had to undergo treatment."
92,19.txt,"The applicant relied on medical reports which revealed that his condition had been stable for a long period (since 1998) but, immediately after his imprisonment, he had suffered serious complications."
93,19.txt,The applicant had been found guilty of a violation of the criminal law which both the Assize Court and the Supreme Court had considered to be sufficiently serious to justify a prison sentence.
94,19.txt,"The applicant’s background and distinguished position should not entitle him to receive any more compensation than any other prisoner who had endured prison life, with its consequent deprivation of liberty, body searches, proximity to other criminals and communal sanitary facilities."
95,19.txt, The Government argued that any loss of reputation and adverse publicity allegedly suffered by the applicant had been a consequence of his own unprofessional and offensive conduct rather than his conviction and imprisonment.
96,19.txt,It was inevitable that the public’s perception of his ability as a lawyer and as a politician would be affected by the publicity surrounding his case.
97,19.txt,"On an objective assessment of the facts, the applicant’s conduct had been inappropriate and of questionable benefit to his client."
98,19.txt,They claimed that the medical reports he had provided did not establish any causal link.
99,19.txt,"Indeed, they pointed out that the applicant had already been suffering from retinopathy for two years before his imprisonment (since December 1998), and that it was not uncommon for diabetic retinopathy to develop over time to include macular oedema."
100,19.txt,The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case.
101,19.txt,"In particular, it considers that the seriousness of the conviction and the prison sentence imposed on the applicant must have had a negative impact on his professional reputation and on his political image, particularly in a small country like Cyprus."
102,19.txt,"However, the Court does not find that the applicant has established a causal link between the deterioration of his health and the breaches of the Convention which it has found."
103,19.txt,"Further, they emphasised that there was no dispute over the underlying facts as to what had happened."
104,19.txt, where the facts constituting the offence were to be proved through witnesses.
105,19.txt,"Although there is authority for the proposition that, if a violation of the principle of impartiality is found, it is not necessary to examine other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention"
106,19.txt,"(see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, § 80)"
