therefore have been made at least in substance in the proceedings
before the competent domestic organs"
5,34.txt,"In the present case that the Commission finds that the first
applicant has not shown that complaints 1(a) to (g), (i) to (n) and (p)
were raised at least in substance before the domestic courts."
6,34.txt,"He has
not therefore exhausted the remedies available to him under Swedish law
in respect of these complaints."
7,34.txt,"Moreover, the Commission finds no
special circumstance which might have absolved this applicant,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedies at his disposal."
8,34.txt," Limiting its examination of the fairness of the proceedings to
the first applicant's complaints 1 (h) and (o), the Commission observes
that he availed himself of his right to challenge Ms. Ekberg's report
by making a request to hear another expert."
9,34.txt,"Accordingly, the Commission will have regard to them when examining the
facts under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
10,34.txt,"It follows
that it cannot examine whether or not the first applicant was guilty
or innocent."
11,34.txt,"It follows that these
complaints must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies
under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
12,34.txt,"There is thus no indication
that there was in this respect a lack of ""equality of arms"" between the
first applicant and the prosecution."
13,34.txt," In conclusion, there is no indication that the first
applicant was denied a fair trial in this respect."
14,34.txt,"in that, as a result, the second
applicant was kept in public care."
15,34.txt,"The Commission finds no appearance
of such a violation."
16,34.txt,"The first and the second applicant complain that the first
applicant was prohibited from taking the second applicant home on his
release from his pre-trial detention,"
17,34.txt,"The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention it may only deal with a complaint within a period of six
months from the date on which the final decision was taken."
18,34.txt,"It observes
that the prohibition complained of was issued on 28 January 1991 and
became obsolete at the latest on 20 June 1991, when the County
Administrative Court ordered the second applicant's placement in public
care."
19,34.txt,"The present application, however, was lodged on 16 November 1992,
that is more than six months later."
20,34.txt,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
21,34.txt,"The Commission observes that the refusal at issue dates back to
28 January 1991."
22,34.txt,"Examining the complaint under Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the
Convention, the Commission finds no appearance of a violation of these
applicants' rights."
23,34.txt,"The Commission finds this complaint
unsubstantiated."
24,34.txt,"The Commission recalls that ""family life"" within the meaning of
Article 8 (Art. 8) may include at least the ties between near relatives
such as grandparents and grandchildren (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Marckx
judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, para. 45)."
25,34.txt,"However,
the existence of ""family life"" will depend on a number of factors and
on the particular circumstances of each case (cf., e.g., No. 12763/87,
Dec. 14.7.88, D.R. 57 p. 216)."
26,34.txt,"The second applicant is the child of the first applicant in his

23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, para. 54)."
28,34.txt,"Moreover, up to his
placement in public care the third and the fourth applicant were
significantly involved in the everyday upbringing of the second
applicant."
29,34.txt,"The Commission recalls that the placement order was based on the
1990 Act and was, accordingly, made in accordance with the law."
30,34.txt,"The
interference furthermore had the legitimate aims of protecting the
second applicant's ""health or morals"" as well as his ""rights and
freedoms"" in general."
31,34.txt,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant."
32,34.txt,"(cf.
Eur. Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130,

had to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States"

ascertaining whether the State has exercised its discretion reasonably,
carefully and in good faith."
35,34.txt,"It cannot confine itself to considering
the relevant decisions in isolation but must look at them in the light
of the case as a whole."
36,34.txt,"It must determine whether the reasons adduced
to justify the interference at issue are ""relevant and sufficient""
(cf. the above-mentioned Olsson judgment, p. 32, para. 68)."
37,34.txt,"In the
present case the Commission notes, in particular, the expert evidence
submitted by the second applicant's present therapist, recommending
that the therapy should continue."
38,34.txt,"However, before the County
Administrative Court the other applicants gave reason to believe that
they would discontinue this therapy if the second applicant's public
care were to be revoked."
39,34.txt,"The Court took this into account when
maintaining public care."
40,34.txt,"It further considered that implementation of
the public care in the third and the fourth applicant's home could lead
to a conflict of interests jeopardising the care, given the other
applicants' objections to the therapy provided as well as the third and
the fourth applicant's belief that the first applicant was innocent."
41,34.txt," In the light of the above and having regard to the State's margin
of appreciation the Commission finds that the public care of the second
applicant has been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that
the Swedish courts could reasonably find it necessary to maintain his
care."
42,34.txt,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant."
43,34.txt,"The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention it may only deal with the matter within a period of six
months from the date on which the final decision was taken."
44,34.txt,"If the
object of a complaint is not a decision, but an ongoing situation, the
six months' period starts at the time when the situation ceases to
exist (see, e.g., No. 11123/84, Dec. 9.12.87, D.R. 54 p. 52)."
45,34.txt," The Commission observes that the second applicant was transferred
from the first ""family home"" to his present ""family home"" on 25 July
1991, whereas the present application was lodged on 16 November 1992,
i.e. more than six months later."
46,34.txt,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
47,34.txt," The Commission cannot find that the second applicant's placement
in the ""family home"" and the related access restrictions amount to a
deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 (Art. 5) of
the Convention."
48,34.txt,"The applicant's request was examined by the Social Council in
December 1992."
49,34.txt,"The applicant's appeal to the County Administrative
Court was decided upon in May 1993 following an oral hearing."
50,34.txt,"His
further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal was decided upon
in September 1993, also after an oral hearing."
51,34.txt,"Leave to appeal was
refused by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.
"
52,34.txt,"The court proceedings involving three courts and two oral
hearings thus lasted less than one and a half year."

Court H.R., Vernillo judgment of 20 February 1991, Series A no. 198,
p. 12, para. 30)."
54,34.txt,"It reiterates that the
reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the
light of the circumstances of each case and having regard to the
following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the
parties and that of the authorities dealing with the case"
55,34.txt,"In the light of the
above criteria and having regard to the particular circumstances of the
case the Commission cannot find that this length exceeded a ""reasonable
time""."
56,34.txt,"Accordingly, there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
57,34.txt,"Assuming
that this provision applies, the Commission observes that under Section
73 of the Social Services Act the third and the fourth applicant had
a right to challenge the Social Council's refusal before the
administrative courts."
58,34.txt,"They did not, however, avail themselves of this
opportunity."
59,34.txt,"No further issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the
Convention.
"
60,34.txt,"The Commission observes that according to the travaux
préparatoires to the 1990 Act a decision not to transfer a child from
a ""family home"" is appealable in administrative court proceedings."
61,34.txt,"It
notes, in particular, that in its judgment of 15 September 1993  the
Administrative Court of Appeal examined the first applicant's criticism
of the conditions in the second applicant's ""family home"" in order to
assess whether his public care should be implemented somewhere else."
62,34.txt,"In these circumstances the first applicant had access to a court and
there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the
Convention."
63,34.txt,No separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13).
64,34.txt,"The Commission finds no indication that the first applicant has
challenged the access restrictions at issue by appealing against the
Social Council's care plan to the administrative courts."
65,34.txt,"The applicants
have not therefore exhausted the remedies available to them under
Swedish law."
66,34.txt,"Moreover, an examination of this complaint does not
disclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have
absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules
of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedies at their
disposal."
67,34.txt,"The Commission considers that the access restrictions now at
issue amounted - and amount - to an interference with the third and the
fourth applicant's ""family life""."
68,34.txt,"In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2
of Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the
requirement that the interference be ""in accordance with the law""
relates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia,
that the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must
moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him."
69,34.txt,"In a sphere
covered by written law, the ""law"" is the enactment in force as the
competent courts have interpreted it"
70,34.txt,"The Commission notes that under Section 11 of the 1990 Act the
Social Council may decide how the public care is to be implemented."
71,34.txt,"The
Commission is further aware that this provision has been considered by
Swedish courts as constituting the legal basis for access restrictions
concerning, for instance, grandparents (see No. 21608/93, Dec. 22.2.95,
not published)."
72,34.txt,"(cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R.,
Kruslin judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, pp. 21-22, para."
73,34.txt,"As for the question
whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in
pursuance of the above aims, the Commission observes that the second
applicant has been allowed to spend one weekend a month in the home of
the third and the fourth applicant, his paternal grandparents, while
being allowed to spend another weekend a month in the home of his
maternal grandparents."
74,34.txt,"Special arrangements have apparently been made
for public holidays."
75,34.txt,"Recalling its considerations in para. 7 above as
regards the necessity of the public care as implemented in a ""family
home"" and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, the
Commission considers that also the access restrictions now complained
of have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that the
Social Council could reasonably find it necessary to order and maintain
them."
76,34.txt,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the third and the fourth applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1
(Art. 8-1) can reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic
society"" within the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2)of that provision in
the interests of the second applicant."
77,34.txt,"Thus, they cannot, on arguable grounds, claim
to have a ""right"" under domestic law."
78,34.txt,"Article 6 (Art. 6) does not
therefore apply in their case."
79,34.txt,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted."
80,34.txt,"The Commission considers that this complaint could be raised in
civil proceedings instituted by the first applicant for the purpose of
claiming the restoration of the money withdrawn (cf. No. 14451/88, Dec.
2.7.93, not published)."
81,34.txt,No such action has been brought.
82,34.txt,"The Commission
recalls that where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a remedy
that remedy must be tried (e.g., No. 10148/82, Dec. 14.3.85, D.R. 42
p. 98)."
83,34.txt," In the above circumstances the Commission finds that it has not
been shown that domestic remedies have been exhausted."
84,34.txt,"Moreover, an
examination of the complaint does not disclose the existence of any
special circumstance which might have absolved the applicants,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedy at their disposal."
85,34.txt,"Leaving aside the question of Sweden's reservation to this
provision, as valid at the relevant time, the Commission observes that
the situation complained of ceased to exist in 1991 when the second
applicant started attending elementary school."
86,34.txt,"The application,
however, was lodged with the Commission on 16 November 1992."
87,34.txt,"Furthermore, an examination of the case does not disclose the existence
of any special circumstances which might have interrupted or suspended
the running of the six month period provided for in Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention."
88,34.txt," The Commission, examining this complaint in the light of the
above-cited Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, cannot find any
evidence that the first applicant has requested access to the notes
concerned."
89,34.txt,"It has therefore not been shown that domestic remedies have
been exhausted."
90,34.txt,"Moreover, an examination of the complaint does not
disclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have
absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules
of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedy at their
disposal."
91,34.txt,"(cf.,
e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Stanford judgment of 23 February 1994, Series
A no. 280-A, para. 24)."
92,34.txt,"The Commission's task is to
ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair"
93,34.txt,"As a general rule, however, it is for the
domestic courts to assess the evidence before them, in particular since
they have the benefit of hearing witnesses and assessing their
credibility"
94,34.txt,"The Commission is
normally not competent to deal with a complaint alleging that errors
of law and fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where
it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation
of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or one of
its Protocols, for instance in that a judgment has no legal
justification and thereby violates a party's right to receive a fair
trial (cf. No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45)."
95,34.txt,"The Commission also recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of
the Convention it may only deal with a complaint after all domestic
remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised
rules under international law."
96,34.txt,"(cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom
judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121-A, p. 32-33, para. 73)."
97,34.txt,"In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the
fourth applicant, the Commission recalls that in order for Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1) to apply to the proceedings in question it must
first be ascertained whether there was a dispute over a ""right"" which
can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under
domestic law"
98,34.txt,"Under
Swedish law the third and the fourth applicant have no right of access
to the second applicant."
99,34.txt,"Such an obligation
confers upon the applicant a right of a procedural nature
distinguishable from the substantive rights set out under Section I of
the Convention or under its Protocols."
100,34.txt,"It flows from the very essence
of this right that it must be open to individuals to complain of
alleged infringements of it in the proceedings before the Commission."
101,34.txt,"In this respect the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing
rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and
illusory"
102,34.txt,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted. It follows that this complaint must also be rejected under
Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
103,34.txt," The Commission recalls that Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) of the
Convention imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to
interfere with the right of the individual effectively to present and
pursue his application before the Commission."
