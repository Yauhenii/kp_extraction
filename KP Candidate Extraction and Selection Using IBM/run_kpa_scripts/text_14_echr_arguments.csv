2,14.txt," In any event, Switzerland was in no way responsible for the situation the Gül family was in."
3,14.txt," Having regard to all these considerations, and while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1). "
4,14.txt,"Admittedly, Mr Gül left Turkey in 1983, when his son Ersin was only three months old (see paragraph 7 above);"
5,14.txt,"Mrs Gül left Ersin in 1987 because of her accident (see paragraph 8 above)."
6,14.txt,"However, after obtaining a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in Switzerland in 1990, the applicant asked the Swiss authorities for permission to bring the boy, who was then six years old, to Switzerland (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). "
7,14.txt,"Subsequently, he repeatedly asked the Swiss courts to allow his son to join him, before bringing his case before the Convention institutions."
8,14.txt,"Despite the distance, in geographical terms, between them, the applicant has made a number of visits to Turkey, the last of these being in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
9,14.txt,"Mr Gül had left Turkey when his younger son Ersin was three months old, and had never attempted to develop a family life in his country of origin."
10,14.txt,"In addition, the focus of that son’s family life was in Turkey since, even after his mother’s departure, the child had been taken in as a member of his elder brother’s family.  "
11,14.txt,"Furthermore, the fact that Mr and Mrs Gül’s daughter Nursal had been placed in a home in Switzerland showed that they were in any event incapable of assuming their parental responsibilities with regard to the boy. "

13,14.txt, In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation
14,14.txt,The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.
15,14.txt,"There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective ""respect"" for family life."
16,14.txt,"However, the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under this provision (art. 8) do not lend themselves to precise definition."
17,14.txt,"The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar."

20,14.txt,"The applicant left Turkey in 1983 and made his way to Switzerland, where he applied for political asylum; this application was rejected by the Minister for Refugees in 1989 (see paragraph 10 above)."
21,14.txt,His wife joined him in 1987 so that she could receive medical treatment in Switzerland after a serious accident.
22,14.txt,Their daughter Nursal was placed from birth in a home in Switzerland and has remained there ever since (see paragraph 9 above).
23,14.txt,In 1990 Mr and Mrs Gül were granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and then sought permission to bring their son Ersin to Switzerland.
24,14.txt,"Ersin has always lived in Turkey (see paragraph 19 above). "
25,14.txt,"By leaving Turkey in 1983, Mr Gül caused the separation from his son, and he was unable to prove to the Swiss authorities - who refused to grant him political refugee status - that he personally had been a victim of persecution in his home country."
26,14.txt,"In any event, whatever the applicant’s initial reasons for applying for political asylum, the visits he has made to his son in recent years tend to show that they are no longer valid."
27,14.txt,"His counsel, moreover, expressly confirmed this at the hearing. "
28,14.txt,"In addition, according to the Government, by virtue of a social security convention concluded on 1 May 1969 between Switzerland and Turkey, the applicant could continue to receive his ordinary invalidity pension and half of the supplementary benefit he receives at present in respect of his wife, his son Ersin and his daughter Nursal if he returned to his home country (see paragraph 23 above)."
29,14.txt,"Mrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic, since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds."
30,14.txt,"However, although her state of health seemed particularly alarming in 1987, when her accident occurred, it has not been proved that she could not later have received appropriate medical treatment in specialist hospitals in Turkey. "
31,14.txt,"She was, moreover, able to visit Turkey with her husband in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
32,14.txt,"Furthermore, although Mr and Mrs Gül are lawfully resident in Switzerland, they do not have a permanent right of abode, as they do not have a settlement permit but merely a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which could be withdrawn, and which under Swiss law does not give them a right to family reunion (see paragraph 18 above). "
33,14.txt,"  In view of the length of time Mr and Mrs Gül have lived in Switzerland, it would admittedly not be easy for them to return to Turkey, but there are, strictly speaking, no obstacles preventing them from developing family life in Turkey."
34,14.txt,That possibility is all the more real because Ersin has always lived there and has therefore grown up in the cultural and linguistic environment of his country.
35,14.txt," Having regard to all these considerations,"
36,14.txt,"while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, "
37,14.txt,"True, as the Court recognised in the Berrehab judgment, subsequent events may break such a family life relationship, but only exceptional circumstances can warrant the conclusion that the tie between a parent and his or her child is severed."
38,14.txt,"The mere fact that, at the relevant date, the applicant had not seen his then seven-year-old son for almost seven years is not sufficient to produce this negative effect."
39,14.txt,"""According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’"", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned."
40,14.txt,"Rightly so, for, generally speaking, it may be assumed that after a period of between three and five years immigrants become rooted in the country of settlement."
41,14.txt,By then they have formed new social ties there and have definitively begun to adapt themselves to their new homeland.
42,14.txt," In assessing the humaneness of the choice with which the Swiss authorities confronted the applicant and his wife this element, the fact that they have become integrated in their new homeland - an element which, incidentally, is closely connected with their private life - is of far more importance than the formal status of their permit."
43,14.txt,"The first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind."
44,14.txt,"The second is that the applicant’s wife is dependent on medical care which she can certainly get in Switzerland, whilst it is in debate to what extent, if at all, she will be able to get it in Turkey."
45,14.txt,"The third is that the mere fact that the Turkish authorities did not immediately arrest the applicant when he entered the country as a visitor does not imply that he would not get into trouble if he tried to settle there again on a permanent basis."
46,14.txt,"The fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990."
47,14.txt,"Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey."
48,14.txt,On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin. 
49,14.txt,"Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife,"
50,14.txt,"it follows from the aforementioned Berrehab judgment (p. 14, para. 21) that there is ipso facto such a relationship (see also the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 54)."
51,14.txt,"The present case concerns not only family life but also immigration, and the extent of a State’s obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest."
52,14.txt,"As a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory (see, among other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67)."
53,14.txt,"Moreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.  "
54,14.txt,"In order to establish the scope of the State’s obligations, the facts of the case must be considered (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 32, para. 88). "
55,14.txt,since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.
56,14.txt,"The Court now holds that the applicable principles are similar, adding that in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community"
57,14.txt," For present purposes it may, therefore, be assumed that it makes no material difference whether a positive or a negative obligation is at stake. "
58,14.txt,"The present doctrine notably implies that the distinction between the two types of obligation has no bearing on either the burden of proof or the standards for assessing whether a fair balance has been struck."
59,14.txt,"(see, inter alia: the above-mentioned Keegan judgment, loc. cit. (paragraph 7 above); the above-mentioned Hokkanen judgment, p. 20, para. 55; and the Stjerna v. Finland judgment of 25 November 1994, Series A no. 299-B, p. 61, para. 39)."
