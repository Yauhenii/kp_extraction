1,15.txt,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
2,15.txt,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
3,15.txt,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison."
4,15.txt,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
5,15.txt,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions."
6,15.txt,"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).  "
7,15.txt," In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
8,15.txt,"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision (art. 64)."
9,15.txt,"Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  "
10,15.txt," Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
11,15.txt,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here"
12,15.txt,"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
13,15.txt,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions (art. 5, art. 64) applied in the present case are covered by that reservation.  "
14,15.txt,"They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case."
15,15.txt,"The Court notes that Mr Gradinger based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
16,15.txt,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
17,15.txt,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied."
18,15.txt,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
19,15.txt,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
20,15.txt,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
21,15.txt,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority. "
22,15.txt,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  "
23,15.txt,"(see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
24,15.txt,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  "
25,15.txt,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"""
26,15.txt,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
27,15.txt,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
28,15.txt,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
29,15.txt,"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
30,15.txt,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
31,15.txt,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
32,15.txt," Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 26 above).  "
33,15.txt,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 24, para. 49)."
34,15.txt,"(see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 20)."
35,15.txt," the Court considers that the ""declaration"" is to be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention"
36,15.txt,"It is therefore necessary to determine whether the declaration satisfies the requirements of that provision (art. 64).  "
37,15.txt," The Court notes at the outset that there is no ""brief statement"" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4)."
38,15.txt,"Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the ""declaration"" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not ""criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure"" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this."
39,15.txt,"Nevertheless, with a description of this nature, which is not exhaustive, the ""declaration"" does not afford to a sufficient degree ""a guarantee ... that [it] does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded"" by Austria"
40,15.txt,"Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision."
41,15.txt,That provision (P7-4) does not therefore apply before new proceedings have been opened.
42,15.txt,"In the present case, inasmuch as the new proceedings reached their conclusion in a decision later in date than the entry into force of Protocol No. 7 (P7), namely the Administrative Court's judgment of 29 March 1989,"
43,15.txt,"The latter were different in nature and pursued different aims: whereas Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code punished homicide committed while under the influence of drink, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act punished the mere fact of driving a vehicle while intoxicated."
44,15.txt,"The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. "
45,15.txt," The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant. "
46,15.txt,"On the other hand, the administrative authorities found, in order to bring the applicant's case within the ambit of section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, that that alcohol level had been attained."
47,15.txt,"The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose."
48,15.txt,It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.
49,15.txt," Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct."
50,15.txt,"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
51,15.txt,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  
52,15.txt,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
53,15.txt," In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above)."
