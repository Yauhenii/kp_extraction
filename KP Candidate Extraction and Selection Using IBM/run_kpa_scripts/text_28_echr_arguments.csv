1,28.txt,"Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution."
2,28.txt,"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations."
3,28.txt,it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.
4,28.txt,This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable.
5,28.txt,"Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous."
6,28.txt,"The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail."
7,28.txt,"A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31)."
8,28.txt,"It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
9,28.txt, The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.
10,28.txt,"In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended."
11,28.txt,It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked.
12,28.txt,"Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the ""necessity"" of the interference."
13,28.txt, It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith.
14,28.txt,"Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above)."
15,28.txt,"However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention."
16,28.txt,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
17,28.txt,The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.
18,28.txt,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
19,28.txt,  The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.
20,28.txt,"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities."
21,28.txt,"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49)."
22,28.txt,"indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed."
23,28.txt,"Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice."
24,28.txt,"In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued."
25,28.txt,This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings.
26,28.txt,"Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above)."
27,28.txt,"Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive."
28,28.txt,"It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46)."
29,28.txt,"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above)."
30,28.txt,"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it."
31,28.txt,"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. "
32,28.txt,"In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence."
33,28.txt,The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.
34,28.txt,"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public."
35,28.txt,  It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.
36,28.txt,"However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above)."
37,28.txt,"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention"
38,28.txt, In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.
39,28.txt,It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.
40,28.txt,"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2)."
41,28.txt,The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.
42,28.txt,Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.
43,28.txt,"Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance."
44,28.txt,"However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14)."
45,28.txt,In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14).
46,28.txt,"instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had been a video showing, for example, the anti-clerical Voltaire having sexual relations with some prince or king."
47,28.txt,"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom  applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works."
48,28.txt,"Judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 46"
49,28.txt,Section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984
50,28.txt,"Of course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary."
51,28.txt,"It must, if contested, be subject to judicial review, and it must not have the effect of preventing the courts from deciding, as the case may be, whether the work concerned deserves, or does not deserve, any sanction under existing law."
52,28.txt,This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case.
53,28.txt,It certainly goes too far. 4.
54,28.txt,"To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question."
55,28.txt,"I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society""."
56,28.txt,The British Board of Film Classification and the five-member panel of the VAC took the view that the applicant would commit an offence of blasphemy if his video work Visions of Ecstasy were to be distributed (see paragraph 20 of the judgment).
57,28.txt,In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.
58,28.txt,The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.
59,28.txt,The actual opinion of believers remains unknown. 
60,28.txt,"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment)."
61,28.txt,"As the Court has consistently held, the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) apply not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that shock or disturb."
62,28.txt,Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.
63,28.txt,"since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith."
64,28.txt,"The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive."
65,28.txt,"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above)."
66,28.txt,The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.
67,28.txt,"As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries."
68,28.txt,It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.
69,28.txt,In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).
70,28.txt,"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above). "
71,28.txt,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49)."
72,28.txt,"Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions."
73,28.txt,"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations."
74,28.txt,"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35)."
75,28.txt,This does not of course exclude final European supervision.
76,28.txt,Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material
77,28.txt,"Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60)."
78,28.txt,The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).
79,28.txt,"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion."
80,28.txt,Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.
81,28.txt,"As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control."
82,28.txt,"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness."
83,28.txt,"The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness."
