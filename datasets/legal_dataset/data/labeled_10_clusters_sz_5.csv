443,1,"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v.

444,1," It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

(Art. 7-1) of the Convention.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
446,1,"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
447,1,"it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs should have been raised at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"" (Eur. Court H.R., Castells judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, para. 27).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
448,1,"In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
449,1,The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).,"A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
450,1,"In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
451,1,"The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

453,1,The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above).,"A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
454,1,"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above). ","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
455,1,"If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the

ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
456,1,"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
457,1,"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

exhausting the domestic remedies at his disposal.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
460,1,They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions.,"A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

462,1,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v.

465,1,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. ","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
466,1,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority. ","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
467,1,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).,"A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

469,1,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

471,1,"The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

473,1," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."
475,1,"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

478,1,"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one.","A complaint has been made to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, on the grounds that he has failed to fulfil his obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights."

1295,3,"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."

other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in

1297,3,"The first applicant also alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, which provides:","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1298,3,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy, cited above, § 95, Aydın, cited above, § 103, and Kaya, cited above, § 89).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1299,3,"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1300,3,"However, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1301,3, The Court recalls that the primary concern of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is protection from an arbitrary deprivation of liberty.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1302,3,"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1303,3," The applicants further submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) should be
interpreted as including a procedural element, namely, the provision
of an effective procedure after a lethal shooting for establishing the
facts.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1304,3,"If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1305,3,"Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:

      one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases
      and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:

      court;

      (b)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-

1306,3,"The Commission finds that the applicant was deprived of his liberty ""after conviction by a competent court"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (Art. 5-1-a) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1307,3,"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1308,3,The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1309,3,No separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1310,3,"In these circumstances, and having regard to its conclusion under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it appropriate to draw inferences proposed by the applicants as to whether torture or ill-treatment occurred (see, in this respect, Tanlı, cited above, § 159).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1311,3,"Relying on the Commission's case-law on the question, they submitted that the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) was so closely and directly bound up with the deceased applicant's person that his heirs could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable them to continue the proceedings in his stead.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1312,3,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1313,3,"The Commission also finds no evidence in the case to suggest an infringement of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (Art. 5-3, 5-4):","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1314,3,"In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2
of Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the
requirement that the interference be ""in accordance with the law""
relates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia,
that the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must
moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1315,3," In respect of the first applicant, the Court reiterates that this provision guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1316,3,"   The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1317,3,"The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to
Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1318,3,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 (art. 13) must be ""effective"" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1319,3,The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1320,3,"As to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, the Government submit that Turkish law guarantees several remedies (as described above at pp. 5-6) without discrimination.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1321,3,"As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1322,3,under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1323,3,The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1324,3,"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to

the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1325,3,"Having regard to the conclusion it reached with regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 106), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily”","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1326,3,"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1327,3,"Her Majesty's Pleasure does not satisfy the
requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) since the Parole Board,
save immediately after recall, is unable to order release, the ultimate
decision resting with the executive. An applicant also has no right to
an oral hearing before the Board or to call his own witnesses or to
question the witnesses against him.

      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the
parties concerning the complaints raised by the applicant.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1328,3,"The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (Oğur, cited above, § 88).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1329,3," Having regard to all these considerations, and while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1). ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1330,3,"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1331,3,"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1332,3,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1333,3,"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1334,3,Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1335,3,"No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1336,3,"Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) provides as follows:

      ""Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in
      contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an
      enforceable right to compensation.""","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1337,3,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1338,3," Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows:

""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this
Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy
before a national authority notwithstanding that the
violation has been committed by persons acting in an
official capacity.""","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1339,3,"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1340,3,These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1341,3,"In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1342,3,"Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50). ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1343,3," As the Court has held many times, Article 13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1344,3,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1345,3,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 24 above). ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1346,3,Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1347,3,"Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1348,3," In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1349,3,"The Court notes that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law (Article 28 para. 1 of the Constitution - see paragraph 19 above).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1350,3,The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1351,3,The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1352,3,No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1353,3,"The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1354,3," The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant. ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1355,3," The Government submitted that Mr Ahmet Sadik had not exhausted domestic remedies, not having raised before the national courts, even in substance, the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1356,3,"They continuously reviewed the
detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's
health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.
","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1357,3, It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1358,3,"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1359,3,"The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:
""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...
...
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ...""","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1360,3," The Commission, examining this complaint in the light of the
above-cited Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, cannot find any
evidence that the first applicant has requested access to the notes
concerned.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1361,3,The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1362,3,"At no time, however, did the applicant rely on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), or on arguments to the same or like effect based on domestic law, in the courts dealing with his case. ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1363,3,"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1364,3,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1365,3,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1366,3,"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1367,3,"Applying the above general considerations to the case of Ahmet Sadik I note in the first place that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law  and that, moreover, Article 10 (art. 10) is directly applicable under Greek law.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1368,3,"The Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was ""lawful"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected ""in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law"".","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1369,3,"Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1370,3,"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention"".","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1371,3,"They
submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) requires, in addition, that States
exercise strict operational control over the use of lethal force,
including the giving of appropriate training, briefings and
instructions.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1372,3,"Consequently, my starting-point is that the Greek Supreme Court, when dealing with the applicant's appeal against his conviction by the Patras Court of Appeal, in principle could and should have applied Article 10 (art. 10) - as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights - ex officio (see paragraph 11 above). ","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1373,3,"In domestic law, sado-masochistic activities could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence without that being contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1374,3,"It involves rights under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention which is absolute, unqualified and non-derogable.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1375,3,"They consider
that Article 2 (Art. 2) imposes a duty on States to adopt clear and
detailed legal rules on the use of lethal force, which strictly control
and limit that use.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1376,3,"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)"".","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1377,3,"Whether or not a right to reputation is enshrined in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is immaterial, since such a right does exist, at least in principle, under all our national laws and it has not been contended that in this respect English law makes an exception by clearly and fully excluding such a right.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1378,3," Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1379,3,"For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 78-80), no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which may be broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Articles 2 and 3 (Kaya, cited above, pp. 330-331, § 107, Salman, cited above, § 123, and Nuray Şen v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, § 193, 30 March 2004).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1380,3,The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1381,3,Mr Ahmet Sadik could therefore have relied on that provision (art. 10) in the Greek courts and complained of a violation thereof in his case. ,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1382,3,"The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1383,3," As regards the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention and the derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15), the applicant contested the necessity of a measure permitting detention for as long as 30 days without any of the basic safeguards against abuse, which were deemed to be essential by the Convention organs","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1384,3,The nature of the rights safeguarded under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1385,3,"an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies; and

-     whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies were ineffective in this case, owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress.
","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1386,3,Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1387,3,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the third and the fourth applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1
(Art. 8-1) can reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic
society"" within the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2)of that provision in
the interests of the second applicant.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1388,3,The Commission recalls that under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention the right to compensation is conditional on a breach of one of the paragraphs of Article 5 (Art. 5).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1389,3,"Before the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above).","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1390,3,"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty.","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
1391,3,The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has upheld the decision of the St Plten Regional Court to release on bail Ahmet Sadik, who had been arrested for drinking and driving."
