335,14,"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."

342,14,hey constituted a sui generis procedure aimed at securing the unimpeded functioning of the courts and safeguarding the authority of the judiciary.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
343,14,"However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
344,14,"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
345,14," It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
346,14,"He has not, therefore, been
""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1
(Art. 7-1) of the Convention.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
347,14,"it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs should have been raised at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"" (Eur. Court H.R., Castells judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, para. 27).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
348,14,The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
349,14,"The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
350,14,The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
351,14,"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above). ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
352,14,"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
353,14,"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
354,14," The Court notes at the outset that there is no ""brief statement"" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
355,14,They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
356,14,He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
357,14,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7)","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
358,14,"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom  applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
359,14,"In all cases before the Court, what is in issue is the international responsibility of the State","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
360,14,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
361,14,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
362,14,"The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
363,14," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
364,14,"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
365,14,"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
366,14,"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
367,14,"The Inspectors described Lonrho and the Fayed brothers as ""bitterly antagonistic parties"" (see paragraph 19 in fine above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
368,14,"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
369,14,"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
370,14,"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
371,14,  It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
372,14,"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
373,14,It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
374,14,"Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
375,14,It is evident from the facts established by the national courts,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
376,14,The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
377,14,"A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
378,14,it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
379,14,"Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as ""the rules of natural justice"" (see paragraph 39 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
380,14,"As regards more specifically investigations under the Companies Act, the British courts have explained that ""the public interest demands"" that ""Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness"" (per Lord Denning in re Pergamon Press Ltd - see paragraph 43 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
381,14,"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d)).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
382,14,The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
383,14,It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
384,14,"The applicant argued that he had been humiliated and treated like a common criminal despite the fact that he had been a law-abiding citizen, a member of parliament and an advocate for about 40 years, with an unblemished record.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
385,14," The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a
violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
386,14," A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
387,14,"The grounds on which judicial review may be sought (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) are such that it would not have ensured access to a court for determination of the truth of statements made about the applicants in the Inspectors’ report, the absence of such access being the essence of their complaints under the Convention.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
388,14,"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention. ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
389,14,The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
390,14,"Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
391,14,"Thus, they
conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings
being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that
if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may
nevertheless be convicted under these. ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
392,14,It certainly goes too far. 4.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
393,14,"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."

395,14,"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. ","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
396,14,"This right to a court ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law;","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."

398,14,The Court endorses in this respect the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Offutt v. USA (348 U.S. 11. 75 S.Ct.11):,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
399,14,"""According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’"", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned.","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
400,14,"As to the contested limitation on the ability to take legal proceedings, it was common ground that any defamation action brought by the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State would have been successfully met with a defence of privilege, be it absolute or qualified (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
401,14,Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.,"The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
402,14,"Moreover, it is clear from the judgment of the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."

406,14,"The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
407,14," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).","The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to suspend the custody proceedings in the case of the former Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."

1060,12," The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44).",Sri Lanka's military court-martial system has been criticised by the European Court of Human Rights.

1069,12," Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable.",Sri Lanka's military court-martial system has been criticised by the European Court of Human Rights.

of a delay on the part of the applicant in introducing his application

1086,12,"Likewise, no dispute (contestation) between the Secretary of State or the Inspectors and the applicants as to the lawfulness of any alleged interference with the applicants’ right to reputation arose merely because the applicants contested the grounds on which the Minister decided to appoint the Inspectors and on which the Inspectors conducted their lines of inquiry.",Sri Lanka's military court-martial system has been criticised by the European Court of Human Rights.

1246,13,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1247,13,"No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58).",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.

      enforceable right to compensation.""",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1249,13,"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1250,13,"Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50). ",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1251,13,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above).",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1252,13,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 24 above).

1253,13,"Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law ",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1254,13," In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1255,13,No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1256,13, It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1257,13,"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41).",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1258,13,"The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:
""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...
...
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ...""",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1259,13,The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established.,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1260,13,"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1261,13,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1262,13,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1263,13,"The Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was ""lawful"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected ""in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law"".",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1264,13,"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention"".",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1265,13,"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)"".",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1266,13,"The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1267,13,Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1268,13,The Commission recalls that under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention the right to compensation is conditional on a breach of one of the paragraphs of Article 5 (Art. 5).,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1269,13,"Before the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above).",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1270,13,"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty.",The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
1271,13,The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).,The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in a case brought by the European Commission against the French government on the issue of the right of access to justice in France.
