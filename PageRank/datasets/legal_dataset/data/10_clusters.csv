0,2,It recalls both its own findings and those of the Commission as to the general inadequacy and unreliability of custody records
0,2,This is demonstrated in other cases pending before the Commission.
0,2,Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids.
0,2,"In the present case,
there was a formidable case against the applicant which called for
evidence from the applicant if there was an innocent explanation for
his conduct."
0,2,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
0,2,"It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989,"
0,2,"He also wrote a book which was published
after his release."
0,2,"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies."
0,2,"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention"
0,2," The restraint was
also not proportionate to the aim,"
0,2,"Moreover, if contempt proceedings had been brought before a different bench, there would have been certain undesirable consequences that could not have been overlooked: the members of the bench would have had to testify about the events which had taken place before their eyes."
0,2,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
0,2,This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case.
0,2,"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations."
0,2,"This injury was consistent with Palestinian hanging.
"
0,2,The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.
0,2,"The mere
fact that, by virtue of general words a complaint is not excluded from
an application, is not sufficient to regard that complaint as having
been made. "
0,2," For present purposes it may, therefore, be assumed that it makes no material difference whether a positive or a negative obligation is at stake. "
0,2,The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all.
0,2,All communication was via a sound link.
0,2,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  
0,2,"The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute"
0,2," In this context, the Commission had
regard to the criminal proceedings instituted against three police
officers upon accusations of ill-treatment raised by the applicant's
husband, which the applicant's husband joined as a private party
claiming compensation."
0,2,"An applicant does not need
to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach."
0,2,The actual opinion of believers remains unknown. 
0,2, I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria. 
0,2,"Having found the aim of not only making but also publishing Inspectors’ reports to be legitimate, the Court cannot apply the test of proportionality in such a way as to render publication impracticable."
0,2, The notion of security of person has not been given an independent interpretation
0,2,"  For this condition to be fulfilled, it is not sufficient for the applicant merely to have presented his case to the various courts competent to deal with it."
0,2, I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria.
0,2,He was questioned about his individual application and was asked whether the signatures on the letter of authority and his statement to the Human Rights Association belonged to him.
0,2," In reply the applicant maintains that the breach of which he is complaining consists of a continuing violation,"
0,2,They claimed that the medical reports he had provided did not establish any causal link.
0,2,The Commission notes that the applicant's conviction involved his writings.
0,2,"Elements of the latter kind, he claimed, had been provided which should be capable of so satisfying an objective observer."
0,2,The fact that the behaviour concerned takes place on private premises does not suffice to ensure complete immunity and impunity.
0,2,"because it cannot cover offences which were not in force
at the date of the reservation."
0,2,"Moreover, when asked to sign a statement, he had answered that he could not sign because he could not move his hands."
0,2,"An applicant does not need
to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach."
0,2,"However,
special considerations could apply in exceptional cases where an
applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later
stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances
which make that remedy ineffective."
0,2,Such investigations as were carried out were biased and inadequate.
0,2,"The Inspectors did not adjudicate, either in form or in substance."
0,2,"Insofar as certain management restrictions were placed on Harrods Bank by the Bank of England one month after publication of the report, the Commission notes that the applicants had a right of appeal to an independent tribunal which does not appear to have been tried

(pp. 14-15 above)."
0,2,"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,"
0,2,"The extensive publicity
 
after the report's publication was ephemeral."
0,2,"In the present case that the Commission finds that the first
applicant has not shown that complaints 1(a) to (g), (i) to (n) and (p)
were raised at least in substance before the domestic courts."
0,2,"The Commission's task is to
ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair"
0,2,What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form.
0,2,They were not proceedings brought by one of the parties or by a complainant.
0,2,"The mere fact that, at the relevant date, the applicant had not seen his then seven-year-old son for almost seven years is not sufficient to produce this negative effect."
0,2,"Of course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary."
0,2,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case. 
0,2,"On an objective assessment of the facts, the applicant’s conduct had been inappropriate and of questionable benefit to his client."
0,2,"However, the applicant's various complaints raise
different issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione
temporis."
0,2, These measures undoubtedly pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.
0,2,No evidence of any significant economic prejudice has been submitted to it.
0,2,"as it is not intended to have legally binding effects on the
interpretation."
0,2,In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.
0,2,"It seriously damaged their reputation and financial standing and, thereby, harmed their economic interests in the business of HOF. "
0,2,"  The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the
applicant have not yet been terminated. "
0,2,"However, again, the Commission finds no evidence in the case to substantiate this complaint."
0,2,"It cannot confine itself to considering
the relevant decisions in isolation but must look at them in the light
of the case as a whole."
0,2, it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.
0,2,"However contrary to the applicants' allegations of torture, it observes from the photographs and the autopsy report that there were no marks or injuries on the body of Mehmet Şah which were consistent with the allegations of torture."
0,2,"It reiterates that the
reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the
light of the circumstances of each case and having regard to the
following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the
parties and that of the authorities dealing with the case"
0,2,He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions. 
0,2," The
Commission, taking into account the applicant's position in these
proceedings and the impact of their outcome on her own financial
situation,"
0,2, The Prosecutor-General’s submission on the applicant’s complaints included the following observations.
0,2," In the present case, the Commission notes that none of these complaints has been raised either formally or even in substance during the proceedings before the Court of Cassation."
0,2,"However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings,"
0,2,"In this
respect, they refer to the numerous other matters related to the
proceedings at issue, and the proceedings before the Vienna Juvenile
Court."
0,2,"This is not an obligation of result, but of means. "
0,2, It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred
0,2,"Further, they point out that applicant took up residence on her land without prior planning permission."
0,2,"It may thus be open to question whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely within the notion of ""private life"" in the particular circumstances of the case."
0,2,It is therefore necessary to determine whether the declaration satisfies the requirements of that provision (art. 64).  
0,2,"He had considered, having regard to the circumstances and complexity of the case, that this could only be determined in the course of the preliminary investigations."
0,2,"The organs of the Union may adopt resolutions which are
communicated by the parliamentarians concerned to the national
parliaments and to international organisations.
"
0,2," In the present case, the applicant did not bring private
prosecution proceedings against the police officers concerned for
insult, or, assuming that the alleged acts had to be prosecuted ex
officio, lay any criminal charges against the police officers
requesting their prosecution."
0,2,"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations."
0,2,"As regards the refusal of permission to the applicant's solicitor
to be present during his interviews with the police"
0,2,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.
0,2,"They submit in particular
that the applicant did not bring private prosecution proceedings
against the police officers concerned for insult within the meaning of
S. 115 of the Penal Code."
0,2," In the present case, the Commission notes that none of these complaints has been raised either formally or even in substance during the proceedings before the Court of Cassation."
0,2,"Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above)"
0,2,They themselves said in their report that their findings would not be dispositive of anything (see paragraph 21 above).
0,2,The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.
0,2,Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future.
0,2,"becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances
which make that remedy ineffective."
0,2,The applicants have further submitted that they were singled out partly because of the authorities’ bias against homosexuals
0,2," In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language."
0,2,that it would not be justified to strike it off the list of cases.
0,2,In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled.
0,2,This does not of course exclude final European supervision.
0,2,"However, the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under this provision (art. 8) do not lend themselves to precise definition."
0,2,"The case-law of the Commission establishes that where no domestic
remedy is available, the six months period runs from the act complained
of"
0,2,Not everything that happens behind closed doors is necessarily acceptable.
0,2,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
0,2, It would appear to have been administered with the aim of obtaining admissions or information from the applicant.
0,2,The Commission finds that no elements of arbitrariness are disclosed in the present case.
0,2," It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"". "
0,2, In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:
0,2,They have contended that the report could not be used as evidence in those proceedings.
0,2,This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings.
0,2,"In these circumstances, the Commission did not find it necessary to examine whether the detention was ""lawful"" under domestic law."
0,2,Not every aspect of private life automatically qualifies for protection under the Convention.
0,2,"The applicant considers that her ill-treatment amounted to bodily
assault which had to be prosecuted ex officio and"
0,2,"In these circumstances, bearing in mind the degree of organisation involved in the offences, the measures taken against the applicants cannot be regarded as disproportionate."
0,2,The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.
0,2,"While exceptions to this principle had developed, these were strictly limited to circumstances where, for example, there had been a court order or formal separation agreement."
0,2,The scope of this margin of appreciation is not identical in each case but will vary according to the context.
0,2,No single judge had any interest in them.
0,2,"Although such conduct contributed to prolonging the proceedings, it is not in itself sufficient to explain the length of the extensive proceedings. "
0,2,The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants. 
0,2,"The Order merely allows the trier of fact
to draw such inferences as common sense dictates."
0,2,Restrictions were put on their management of Harrods Bank.
0,2,"The complaint made before the Commission must also have been raised, at least in substance, during the proceedings in question."
0,2,"it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim "
0,2,"that she filed numerous
submissions"
0,2," The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective."
0,2,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.
0,2,"since  the law permitting such orders is not formulated with sufficient
precision to enable the individual to foresee with reasonable certainty
when it will be applied."
0,2,"If the
object of a complaint is not a decision, but an ongoing situation, the
six months' period starts at the time when the situation ceases to
exist (see, e.g., No. 11123/84, Dec. 9.12.87, D.R. 54 p. 52)."
0,2, It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.
0,2, My main objection to this paragraph is the following.
0,2,The proceedings were not adversarial in the sense that one person was opposed to another; they concerned the integrity of the judicial system.
0,2,This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable.
0,2,"In the light of the
above criteria and having regard to the particular circumstances of the
case the Commission cannot find that this length exceeded a ""reasonable
time""."
0,2, The Commission notes the applicant's declaration that he had told the public prosecutor that he had been tortured. 
0,2,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
0,2,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation."
0,2, It further appears from the autopsy report that Mehmet Şah was shot from behind by a bullet which entered from the upper part of his shoulder and exited from below his chest.
0,2,"Nonetheless, Contracting Parties do not enjoy an unlimited discretion."
0,2,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.
0,2,The present doctrine notably implies that the distinction between the two types of obligation has no bearing on either the burden of proof or the standards for assessing whether a fair balance has been struck.
0,2," Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct."
0,2,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
0,2,"Doctors must be free to give
honest accounts of what they have found in their investigations."
0,2,"The Commission finds no appearance
of such a violation."
0,2," It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal""."
0,2,The measures had been in keeping not only with the policies of the government at the time but also with relevant United Nations resolutions on development assistance. 
0,2,"Further, they emphasised that there was no dispute over the underlying facts as to what had happened."
0,2, It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.
0,2,"The Commission finds that they have insufficient
means to pay for legal representation themselves."
0,2,It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF (p. 7 above).
0,2,She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one.
0,2,"They point to the fact that the soldiers were apparently
made to believe (wrongly)"
0,2,"In the present case, the applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic activities for purposes of sexual gratification."
0,2,The restrictions placed on Harrods Bank were made by the Bank of England and were not caused by the publication of the report.
0,2,"These factors, the applicant submits, also contributed to the
overall unfairness of the proceedings against him."
0,2,It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.
0,2,At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.
0,2,"In fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's
contacts with his lawyers."
0,2," even if an investigation is made, the lack of effective action being taken afterwards;"
0,2,"They do not give rise to a ""reasonable"" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence."
0,2,by not having pursued the libel proceedings commenced against The Observer newspaper.
0,2,The assessment of this minimum is relative:
0,2,In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case.
0,2,"Consequently, the Commission finds that the remedy cannot realistically
have been available to the applicants in this case."
0,2," In the above circumstances the Commission finds that it has not
been shown that domestic remedies have been exhausted."
0,2,It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.
0,2," the positive discouragement of those who do wish to seek remedies, as has been demonstrated so tragically in the present case;"
0,2,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
0,2,"The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar."
0,2,"In the
present case the Commission notes, in particular, the expert evidence
submitted by the second applicant's present therapist, recommending
that the therapy should continue."
0,2,This is so whether the activities in question occur in the course of sexual conduct or otherwise.
0,2,According to this incident report an intense clash had taken place which lasted for twenty minutes.
0,2,"The Commission finds that the applicant, who was convicted for
speeding twice in the course of one journey, but over separate
stretches of road, was convicted not of one but of two separate
offences."
0,2,"it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim "
0,2,"The Commission considers, in the light of the criteria
established by the case-law of the Convention institutions on the
question of ""reasonable time"""
0,2,Moreover the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose.
0,2,"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal""."
0,2,"Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965."
0,2,The Commission notes the declaration by the applicant's representatives that the applicant's father wishes to pursue proceedings before the Commission.
0,2,Their own perception and evaluation of the facts and their own judgment are engaged in this process.
0,2,"However, this is not the
correct formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were
brought against the applicant and other persons."
0,2, The concept of private life cannot be stretched indefinitely.
0,2," Having regard to all these considerations,"
0,2,and of not having received a written copy of the first instance judgment in time for the preparation of his appeal.
0,2,"Moreover, the applicant's case was an isolated one which raised no question of general interest. "
0,2,Otherwise the person in contempt would in effect have achieved his purpose.
0,2, My main objection to this paragraph is the following.
0,2,"In the course of these proceedings, the
allegations of the applicant's husband were carefully examined at two
court levels.
"
0,2,Further elements of general interest are cited above at pp. 9 and 13.
0,2,"the complexity of the case,"
0,2,"while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, "
0,2,"because at no time at first instance, on appeal or in cassation did the applicant raise the issues under the Convention, even in substance."
0,2,"If the applicant had produced a good explanation for what he had said, he would not have been found in contempt."
0,2,However it does not appear from the file whether the public prosecutor compared the facts as stated in the incident report with the photographs of the hut taken after the incident.
0,2,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.
0,2,"It flows from the very essence
of this right that it must be open to individuals to complain of
alleged infringements of it in the proceedings before the Commission."
0,2,"thereby caused difficulties to survey the file and to
decide upon all of her requests in due time."
0,2,What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.
0,2,There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim.
0,2,"Furthermore, according to the ballistic report 251 bullet cases had been recovered from the place of the incident."
0,2,"In these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he should not be required to pursue domestic remedies before making a complaint to Strasbourg."
0,2,"  For this condition to be fulfilled, it is not sufficient for the applicant merely to have presented his case to the various courts competent to deal with it."
0,2,Investigations into large scale commercial activities of the present kind and the need to ensure honest dealings fall within the notion of protecting the economic well-being of the country.
1,7,"I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  ."
1,7,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1,7,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:"
1,7,The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and direct hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.
1,7, He agrees that the scope of review by the Constitutional Court and Administrative Court does not comply with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.
1,7,"Accordingly, there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
1,7,"Although there is authority for the proposition that, if a violation of the principle of impartiality is found, it is not necessary to examine other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention"
1,7,In the latter kind of case Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may have a degree of applicability.
1,7,"Whilst it is true that
an action in defamation against these public officials would probably
have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely
reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic
law, rather than the right of access to court for determining the
applicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the
Convention."
1,7," With regard to the declaration made by Austria when
ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the
declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the
Convention"
1,7,"In this way the Article (art. 6-1) embodies the ‘right to a court’, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only"" (loc. cit., p. 18, para. 36)."
1,7,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1,7,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
1,7,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
1,7,"The applicants’ argument would amount to reading into Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) an entitlement to have a report such as the one in the present case not published until after a full judicial hearing repeating, doubtless over a longer time-scale, the same fact-finding exercise as that already carried out by the Inspectors."
1,7,"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1,7,"In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras.

1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed."
1,7,"They maintained that, unlike procedural barriers to access to court, such an exercise by the State of the power to fix the content of a particular civil right did not bring into play Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), although it might on occasions raise an issue in relation to one or other of the substantive rights protected by the Convention (such as the right to respect for private life under Article 8) (art. 8)."
1,7,"Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case."
1,7,Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses.
1,7," The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
1,7,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"""
1,7,"The Commission first recalls that the guarantees in paras. 2 and
3 (Art. 6-2, 6-3)are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set
forth in para. 1 (Art. 6-1)"
1,7,"I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  ."
1,7,"Accordingly, the Commission will have regard to them when examining the
facts under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
1,7,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1,7,The Court recalls that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention is one of the constituent elements of a fair criminal trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1.
1,7,"In the words of the Court’s Golder judgment, ""... Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal."
1,7,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1,7, It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  
1,7," The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraph 11 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
1,7,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1,7,"The fact that the court had stated that what had been said prima facie constituted contempt, and invited representations on the matter, could not be considered a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention."
1,7,"The Court notes that Mr Gradinger based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1,7,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
1,7,"Article 6 (Art. 6) does not
therefore apply in their case."
1,7,"Rather their claim was that where a report by organs of the State has branded an individual as being guilty of wrongdoing such as dishonesty after a procedure not attended by the procedural guarantees of a fair trial, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) grants the individual whose reputation is at stake the right to challenge the findings against him or her in a court of law before publication of the report. "
1,7," It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1,7,"However, an applicant's behaviour constitutes an objective fact which cannot be attributed to the respondent State and which must be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether or not the reasonable time referred to in Article 6 § 1 has been exceeded"
1,7,"However, while Mr Findlay in his application to the Commission may not expressly have invoked his rights under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) to a ""public hearing"" and a ""tribunal established by law"", he does appear to have raised in substance most of the matters which form the basis of his complaints in relation to these two provisions."
1,7,"The Court notes that Mr Palaoro based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1,7,"To the extent that the absence of an oral hearing is raised, the
respondent Government also rely on the Austrian reservation to Article
6 (Art. 6) of the Convention."
1,7, Acceptance of the applicants’ argument would entail that a body carrying out preparatory investigations at the instance of regulatory or other authorities should always be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) by reason of the fact that publication of its findings is liable to damage the reputation of the individuals whose conduct is being investigated.
1,7,"In
the circumstances of the present case, a request under S. 91 of the
Court Organisation Act cannot be considered as an effective remedy to
ensure, regarding the proceedings as a whole, a determination of the
applicant's civil rights and obligations within a ""reasonable time""
within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention."
1,7," It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1,7,Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention underlines the need for special attention to be paid to informing the defendant of the “accusation”.
1,7," In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court cannot find that, in the exercise of their responsibility of regulating the conduct of the affairs of public companies, the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation to limit the applicant brothers’ access to the courts under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the state of the applicable law or as regards the effects of the application of that law to the brothers."
1,7," The applicants contended that the Inspectors’ investigation and, above all, the publication of the Inspectors’ report gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which, in so far as relevant, provides:"
1,7,"Neither can there be doubt as to the right to reputation being a ""civil"" right within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
1,7,The scope of this provision must be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
1,7,"The right of access to the courts secured by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access ‘by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals’."
1,7,"In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the
fourth applicant, the Commission recalls that in order for Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1) to apply to the proceedings in question it must
first be ascertained whether there was a dispute over a ""right"" which
can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under
domestic law"
1,7,The applicant next complains under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention of
1,7,"In short, it cannot be said that the Inspectors’ inquiry ""determined"" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation, for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or that its result was directly decisive for that right."
1,7," Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1,7,"Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) provides that anyone ""charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law""."
1,7,He relies on Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.
1,7," the Court considers that the ""declaration"" is to be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention"
1,7,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1,7,"Judicial review would not, it is true, have provided the applicants with ""the effective remedy"" to which they were claiming to be entitled under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), namely a remedy enabling them to argue before a court that the Inspectors’ findings of fact were simply erroneous."
1,7,"At the hearing, the Commission’s Delegate observed that no causal link had been established between the breach of the Convention complained of by the applicant and the alleged pecuniary damage, and submitted that it was not possible to speculate as to whether the proceedings would have led to a different outcome had they fulfilled the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
1,7,"The Government and the Commission both considered that there had been no violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d)."
1,7,"With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life."
1,7,"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)"
1,7,"Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken."
1,7,"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
1,7,"The Court therefore proposes to proceed on the basis that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable to the facts of the case, the argument before the Court having been directed solely to this Article."
1,7,"The Court recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) embodies the ""right to a court"", of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, for example, the Holy Monasteries v. Greece judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 36-37, para. 80)."
1,7,"Nonetheless, the manner in which findings detrimental to a person’s reputation are arrived at in an administrative investigation, as well as the objectives pursued by the investigation, is relevant for assessing the permissibility under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of a limitation on the person’s opportunities to go to court to enforce his or her civil right to reputation."
1,7,"The Court notes that Mr Pfarrmeier based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1,7,"He alleges a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.

      Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:

      ""1.  In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or
      of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a
      fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
      independent and impartial tribunal established by law...

      3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following
      minimum rights:

      (c)   to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of
      his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for
      legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of
      justice so require."""
1,7,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
1,7,It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  
1,7,"The Commission has found above that the applicants' claims under Article 6 paras. 1 (criminal) and 2, Article 8 (Art. 6-1, 6-2,

8)	of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
1,7,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1,7,"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1,7,"The Court notes that Mr Pramstaller based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1,7,"Accepting that a cause of action based on libel was barred and that judicial review did not provide the desired remedy, some other form of effective access to the courts should have been available to them for this purpose by virtue of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
1,7,"It is
submitted that it is a generally recognised principle of international
law that an accused person cannot be required to incriminate himself,
that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention enshrines this principle, and
that the drawing of an incriminating inference from an accused's
failure to give evidence infringes his right to a fair trial.
"
2,9,"The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge."
2,9,"Indeed, although the Supreme Court had the power to quash the impugned decision on the ground that the composition of the Assize Court had not been such as to guarantee its impartiality, it declined to do so."
2,9,The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case.
2,9," The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing"
2,9,The Court also finds relevant in this connection its observations and conclusions below regarding the complaints of breach of the presumption of innocence and insufficient information as to the nature and cause of the change against the applicant (paragraphs 52-58 and 65-68).
2,9, The Court considers that the decisive feature of the case is that the judges of the court which convicted the applicant were the same judges before whom the contempt was allegedly committed.
2,9," the Court considers that in this case insufficient safeguards were available to the applicant,"
2,9,"As a court of appeal, the Supreme Court did not have full competence to deal de novo with the case, but could only review the first instance judgment for possible legal or manifest factual errors."
2,9,"This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present (see the Dudgeon judgment cited above,"
2,9,Nor does the Court accept the applicants’ submission that no prosecution should have been brought against them since their injuries were not severe and since no medical treatment had been required.
2,9,"Subsequently, he repeatedly asked the Swiss courts to allow his son to join him, before bringing his case before the Convention institutions."
2,9," One of the essential arguments against the Court's doctrine that it has jurisdiction to examine afresh preliminary objections already rejected by the Commission is that this doctrine has rather unpalatable effects: it makes it possible, after long years of Strasbourg proceedings, for very important issues to remain undecided ."
2,9,"In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant was given little opportunity to react to the possibility of such a finding or put forward his own explanations and representations in this respect."
2,9,"The interest of protecting journalistic
sources cannot however outweigh all others and, they argue, in the
assessment of whether ""the interests of justice"" required disclosure
in this particular case, the domestic courts gave full and reasoned
consideration to all the competing interests."
2,9,"They refer to the safeguards
provided in the Order: no inference may be drawn unless the
suspect/accused has been warned in advance of the possible effect;
before any inference is drawn, the prosecution must have established
a prima facie case against the accused; the judge has a discretion
whether to draw an inference and is limited to drawing only such
inferences as may be proper."
2,9,"Furthermore, the material facts which influenced the court’s decision, as expressed in the decision of the majority to impose a prison sentence on him, were not disclosed before that decision."
2,9,"The lack of impartiality is evidenced by the intemperate reaction of the judges to the conduct of the applicant, as evidenced by their haste to try him summarily for the criminal offence of contempt of court without availing themselves of other alternative, less drastic, measures such as a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, refusing to hear the applicant unless he withdrew his statements, or asking him to leave the courtroom."
2,9,"He submits that the present case cannot be distinguished from the R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court ex parte Davies case,"
2,9,"In particular, following the court’s refusal to grant him leave to withdraw from the case and his statement regarding the exchange of “ravasakia” between the judges, the court stated the following:"
2,9,"Without prejudice to its decision on the objection relating to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court considers that Mr Ahmet Sadik's widow and children have a legitimate moral interest in obtaining a ruling that his conviction infringed the right to freedom of expression which he relied on before the Convention institutions. "
2,9," The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses."
2,9, The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.
2,9,"The threat of racial discrimination and persecution is certainly serious in our society, and the Court has rightly emphasised the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations (paragraph 30 of the judgment)."
2,9,"The Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of ill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting."
2,9,Their credibility in connection with the facts of which they had become aware while performing their functions would have had to have been tested by other judges and the very integrity of the judiciary would accordingly have been unnecessarily questioned.
2,9,"Even if the Greek courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention, this cannot have dispensed the applicant from relying on the Convention in those courts or from advancing arguments to the same or like effect before them, thus drawing their attention to the problem he intended to submit subsequently, if need be, to the institutions responsible for European supervision"
2,9,The Court observes that the two applicants are not personally concerned by the detention of these four persons. 
2,9,"However, since this point has not been disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case."
2,9,"Accordingly, this Court has deemed it important that district judges guard against this easy confusion by not sitting themselves in judgment upon misconduct of counsel where the contempt charged is entangled with the judge’s personal feeling against the lawyer”."
2,9,"For these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities."
2,9,"Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument. "
2,9,It is the judges who interpret a certain act or type of conduct as contempt of court.
2,9,"They also point out that the applicant did
not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the
Administrative Court.
"
2,9,"The Court does not find that, in relation to any of the applicants, the means employed by the authorities in this regard were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
2,9,"The Court accepts that the facts, as disclosed by the minutes of the relevant proceedings and the final decision of the Assize Court, reveal that a degree of personal partiality did indeed emerge on the part of the judges during their discussion with the applicant."
2,9,"In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint."
2,9,"This was triggered, to some extent, by the court’s interpretation of the word “ravasakia” as “love letters” instead of “notes” although that word has two possible different meanings (see § 23 above), the particular context in which it was used and the applicant’s statement that he saw:
“with [his] own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to an other when [he] was cross-examining ...”."
2,9,"In order to determine whether any particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction drawn in Article 3 (art. 3) between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment."
2,9,The Court finds no evidence in support of the applicants’ allegations in either the conduct of the proceedings against them or the judgment of the House of Lords.
2,9," In the present case, the Court observes that the applicant was informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him by the Assize Court after the court had already formed the view that the applicant was guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court (see §§ 53‑56 above)."
2,9,The Assize Court’s own duty to ensure a fair trial of the persons accused of murder in the present case required it to possess the summary power to deal with any contempt before it.
2,9,"It considers that the
term ""another procedure"" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention."
2,9,They rely on the absence of any suggestion in the High Court's judgment that the applicant's detention was unlawful.
2,9," In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty during the period under consideration was ""lawful detention"" effected ""on reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence""."
2,9," In this respect an additional important factor is the harsh punishment - immediate imprisonment - which they imposed on the applicant while stating, for example:
i) “We cannot conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person...”"
2,9,"It follows that under this provision, whenever a person’s reputation has been interfered with, he or she is in principle entitled to access to a court meeting its requirements."
2,9,"However, the Court does not find that the applicant has established a causal link between the deterioration of his health and the breaches of the Convention which it has found."
2,9,"In this connection too, the Court does not find that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
2,9,"The applicant notes that in its judgment in the present case the Divisional Court answered the Magistrates' questions, ""Whether before issuing the ... warrant, (they) conducted an adequate inquiry into the appellant's means"", and ""Whether the following finding of fact can be supported by the evidence before the Magistrates' Court, namely that the applicant's failure to pay which led to the liability order being made was due to his culpable neglect"", in the negative."
2,9,"Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
2,9,"These facts were, first, that the Assize Court interpreted the word “ravasakia” to mean “love letters” rather than “notes”; secondly, the court’s objections regarding the applicant’s tone of voice and his gestures to the court which had created “a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court”; and thirdly, the Assize Court’s view that the applicant had accused the court of restricting him and of “doing justice in secret”."
2,9,The personal impartiality of each judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid.).
2,9,The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.
2,9,"However, the Court has not been provided with any fact or information capable of showing that the applicant was at the time reasonably suspected of having sought to obtain for himself or a third party an advantage from his participation in the allocation of funds in question"
2,9,"As regards the applicant’s contention concerning the subjective bias of the judges of the Assize Court, the Court notes that the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the Court’s case-law (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58)."
2,9," According to the Court’s case-law, it is possible for a higher tribunal, in certain circumstances, to make reparation for an initial violation of the Convention"
2,9,"The judges had applied the presumption automatically in their decision-making process, but the facts before them had been such as to rebut that presumption."
2,9,This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . 
2,9,"Given the seriousness of the allegations, the Court is of the opinion that the public prosecutor was under an obligation to gather and record evidence which would help to shed light on the facts of the incident."
2,9,"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence."
2,9,"  In my opinion the Court’s reasoning would have been simpler and more persuasive without all this meandering necessitated by its maintaining the ""arguable claim"" test: there could be no doubt as to the applicants’ right to reputation having been damaged."
2,9,"He argues that, inter alia, these factors meant that he was neither
able to establish upon what basis the relevant bodies made their
decisions nor, therefore, effectively able to participate in any of the
post-hearing reviews and the judicial review proceedings.
"
2,9," The applicant did not institute civil proceedings either, with
a view to claiming compensation in particular as regards the alleged
detrimental consequences of the events in question."
2,9,The Court considers that the destruction of the applicant’s home and possessions in the above circumstances must have caused him suffering of sufficient severity for the acts of the security forces to be categorised as inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3
2,9,They asserted that neither the applicant nor his lawyers had alleged at any stage of the proceedings in the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal - even indirectly or in abstract terms - any infringement whatsoever of the right to freedom of expression.
2,9,The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment.
2,9,"The Court recalls that the Commission found, inter alia, that the applicant was subjected to ""Palestinian hanging"", in other words, that he was stripped naked, with his arms tied together behind his back, and suspended by his arms (see paragraph 23 above).
In the view of the Court this treatment could only have been deliberately inflicted; indeed, a certain amount of preparation and exertion would have been required to carry it out."
2,9,"The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness,"
2,9,"It was clear that the court had made up its mind as to his guilt immediately, and all he had been offered was an opportunity to enter a plea in mitigation as to sentence."
2,9,It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf.
2,9," Accordingly, in view in particular of the lack of any investigation, the Court finds that the applicant was denied an effective remedy in respect of his allegation of torture."
2,9,The long-established power granted to common-law courts to sanction improper conduct committed in their face was a necessary and indispensable element of a fair trial itself.
2,9,The applicant had been found guilty of a violation of the criminal law which both the Assize Court and the Supreme Court had considered to be sufficiently serious to justify a prison sentence.
2,9,"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness."
2,9,"The Supreme Court had independently found that the applicant had been guilty of the offence of contempt, and had upheld the sentence imposed by the Assize Court."
2,9,"In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Assize Court violated the principle of the presumption of innocence."
2,9,The Court sees no reason to depart from the general approach it has adopted in previous cases of a similar nature.
2,9,The relevant principles have been stated by the Court as follows:
2,9,“We consider that what has just been said by Mr Kyprianou and in particular the manner with which he addresses to the Court constitutes a contempt of court and Mr Kyprianou has two choices: either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him or for him to decide whether he should retract.
2,9,The Court is therefore satisfied that there were reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants had been involved in an offence.
2,9,"However, decisions by the administrative councils not to prosecute were always reviewed by the Supreme Administrative Court."
2,9,"I note in the second place that, even supposing that the Greek Supreme Court in criminal cases lacks the power to quash of its own motion, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot ex officio supplement legal arguments for grievances put forward by the appellant."
2,9,"They further consider that she failed
properly to reason her constitutional complaint as regards the alleged
insults so as to enable the Constitutional Court to assume its
competence to entertain this complaint."
2,9,Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.
2,9,"They also point out that the applicant
did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the
Administrative Court."
2,9," In this context I recall that the grievances raised by the applicant were very broad: he maintained, inter alia, that the prosecution case should have been dismissed and that the Patras Court of Appeal had not given sufficient reasons for its decision "
2,9,"The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant."
2,9,"On the basis of the material in its possession and noting that the allegation of ill-treatment is not corroborated by any other evidence, the Court notes that the applicants' complaints are based on hypothesis and speculation rather than on reliable evidence."
2,9,The presumption of innocence required the court to refrain from taking any decision as to the applicant’s guilt until all parties had had an opportunity to make representations.
2,9,"Furthermore, the fact that the applicant had been able to appeal to the Supreme Court, a judicial body with full jurisdiction to review facts and law, cured any possible breach of the impartiality requirement."
2,9,"The dangers of unrestrained permissiveness, which can lead to debauchery, paedophilia (see paragraph 11 of the judgment) or the torture of others, were highlighted at the Stockholm World Conference."
2,9,"Furthermore, they cannot substantiate the reason why these persons have themselves refrained from lodging applications with the Court."
2,9,"The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court."
2,9,"it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion."
2,9,"“If the Court’s reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow (καταστροφικό)”."
2,9," In order for an individual to be entitled to a hearing before a tribunal, there must exist a ""dispute"" (""contestation"") over one of his or her civil rights or obligations."
2,9,"The present case demonstrates that also within the context of an access-to-court issue the ""arguable claim"" test is an unfortunate feature of the Court’s case-law ."
2,9,"It has obliged the Court to adopt a reasoning whose subtleness, to my mind, seems hardly convincing."
2,9," In the present case the Court notes, on the basis of the minutes of the relevant proceedings, that the Assize Court formed and expressed an opinion during its discussion with the applicant amounting to a conclusion that it considered him guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court."
2,9,It was totally unrealistic to suggest that the court had closed its mind to this possibility.
2,9,Other types of behaviour may give rise to civil proceedings (internal telephone tapping for example).
2,9,"While it fell to that court to review the constitutionality of a legislative provision proprio motu, it could not - in the absence of an express application to this effect by the parties - consider whether the provision concerned had been applied to the facts of the case before it in a manner compatible with the Constitution. "
2,9,"in that , allegedly, insufficient reasons were given by the courts to justify his conviction.
"
2,9,"“But judges also are human, and may, in a human way, quite unwittingly identify offence to self with obstruction to law. "
2,9,"In particular, he argues that the criterion
of the ""interests of justice"" is insufficiently certain and renders
impossible the task of a journalist in assessing whether or not he can
give a source an undertaking not to reveal his identity."
2,9,"Turning to the facts of the instant case, the Court observes that it is accepted by the parties that the applicant was indeed interviewed by the public prosecutor on 6 June 1995 as alleged upon the instructions of the Ministry of Justice International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate concerning his application with the Commission (see paragraphs 39 and 56)."
2,9,"It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression. "
2,9,"The Court recalls, however, that because of the special circumstances which existed in his case (see paragraph 57 above), Mr Aksoy did not even attempt to make an application before the civil courts."
2,9,"In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable."
2,9," He claimed to have been kept blindfolded during interrogation, which caused disorientation; to have been suspended from his arms, which were tied together behind his back (""Palestinian hanging""); to have been given electric shocks, which were exacerbated by throwing water over him; and to have been subjected to beatings, slapping and verbal abuse."
2,9,"Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others"" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53)."
2,9," Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor was defective in a number of fundamental aspects."
2,9,"Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that it could not interfere with the judgment of the Assize Court, accepting that that court had a margin of appreciation in imposing a sentence on the applicant."
2,9,"Whether a contempt has been committed must be assessed on the basis of the particular judges’ own personal understanding, feelings, sense of dignity and standards of behaviour."
2,9,"That was clear from the Assize Court’s judgment, where it was stated “Later, after a long break, Mr Kyprianou was given a second chance to say something to the Court, in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour”."
2,9,"The Court agrees with the applicant that, essentially, he was asked for mitigation rather than given a full opportunity to defend himself against a charge which would have grave consequences for his liberty."
2,9," In this respect, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court stated that the applicant “did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to an exchange of ""ravasakia"", that is, ""love letters""” and acknowledged that as “persons” they had been “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns."
2,9,The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge.
2,9,I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all.
3,1,"Even if the decisions of the courts were based rather on the fact that a wife was able unilaterally to withdraw her consent, this was a reasonable interpretation of the existing law in the light of changing social circumstances and clarified the existing elements of the offence."
3,1,"The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed."
3,1,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).
3,1,"Extremely serious accusations were levelled against the Inspectors by the applicants in the press release issued by them on the day of the publication of the Inspectors’ report, including accusations of dishonesty, prejudice, non-respect of agreed procedures, unfairness and total disregard of the principles of natural justice (see paragraph 32 above)."
3,1,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1978, were applied."
3,1,It appears that he has only exercised his discretion under section 9 in five cases and that there is no example of any enforcement of those directions being pursued in the courts. 
3,1,"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision
provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds
which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the
ability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with complaints
against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural
limitation and not a substantive one."
3,1,the Government have referred to a number of judgments by the administrative and criminal courts.
3,1,"Such an obligation
confers upon the applicant a right of a procedural nature
distinguishable from the substantive rights set out under Section I of
the Convention or under its Protocols."
3,1,"As for the framework of regulation, including the designation system, this is stated to represent a proportionate response to the need to protect public safety on the roads as well as the rights of others."
3,1,"In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968)."
3,1,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
3,1,"The applicant has, according to the Government, no
right to an appeal under the Convention and, in any event, the post-
hearing reviews are not, according to the Government, designed to be
full appeals, but rather further pleas in mitigation."
3,1,"In fact, with the exception of Cyprus, this is the practice in the High Contracting Parties to the Convention as regards behaviour which constitutes the criminal offence of contempt of court."
3,1,"Moreover, an
examination of the complaint does not disclose the existence of any
special circumstance which might have absolved the applicants,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedy at their disposal."
3,1," Finally, he reminded the Court that no remedy was available even in theory in relation to his complaint regarding the length of time he was detained without judicial control, since this was perfectly lawful under the domestic legislation (see paragraph 29 above)."
3,1,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
3,1,"Furthermore, in the applicant's case, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords acknowledged that they were changing the law, not merely clarifying it."
3,1,"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation.  There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition"
3,1,"Therefore, ""he provided the national courts with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (Art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them"" (Eur. Court H.R., Guzzardi judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72)."
3,1,"However, a considerable number of people were involved in the activities in question which included, inter alia, the recruitment of new ""members"", the provision of several specially equipped ""chambers"", and the shooting of many videotapes which were distributed among the ""members"" (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above)."
3,1,It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.
3,1,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
3,1," What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom. "
3,1,"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention."
3,1,"The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67)."
3,1,"The competent Ministers and a Parliamentary Select Committee - quite apart, it can be supposed, from a substantial section of public opinion - showed a disposition to accept as correct these findings, publication of which was seen as a kind of sanction (see paragraphs 26, 30, 31, 33 and 34 above).
Such elements or consequences are, it is true, not infrequently found in the context of adjudicatory proceedings."
3,1," In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision
provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds
which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made"
3,1,"As regards the merits of the complaint, the Government, referring
to the case-law of the Convention organs, argue that the length of the
proceedings was mainly due to the complexity of the case."
3,1,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
3,1,"They add, in this respect, that although the offence under Section 5
of the Road Traffic Act was not, as such, in force at the date of the
reservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road
users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users.
"
3,1,"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention"
3,1,"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence."
3,1,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
3,1,"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
3,1,"The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant’s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. "
3,1,Prosecutors in the state of emergency region routinely failed to open investigations into alleged abuses of human rights and frequently refused even to acknowledge complaints.
3,1,This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable.
3,1,(see the similar analysis by the Supreme Court of the United States of America of the function of the Federal Civil Rights Commission in the case of Hannah v. Larche (363 US 420 (1960)).
3,1,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  "
3,1,"Indeed, under Turkish law the prosecutor was under a duty to carry out an investigation."
3,1,It seems to me that the wording used by the Court in paragraph 42 is too vague.
3,1,"It affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the “cause” of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts."
3,1,hey constituted a sui generis procedure aimed at securing the unimpeded functioning of the courts and safeguarding the authority of the judiciary.
3,1,"However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). "
3,1,"It has therefore not been shown that domestic remedies have
been exhausted."
3,1,As regards the conduct of the applicant the Court has consistently held that applicants cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to them under domestic law.
3,1,"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment"
3,1," It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard."
3,1,"He has not, therefore, been
""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1
(Art. 7-1) of the Convention."
3,1,"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own."
3,1,"it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs should have been raised at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"" (Eur. Court H.R., Castells judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, para. 27)."
3,1,"In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature."
3,1,The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).
3,1,"In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
3,1,"The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985."
3,1,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
3,1,The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above).
3,1,"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above). "
3,1,"If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the

ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions."
3,1,"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above)."
3,1,"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47)."
3,1," The Court notes at the outset that there is no ""brief statement"" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4)."
3,1,"Moreover, the Commission finds no
special circumstance which might have absolved this applicant,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedies at his disposal."
3,1,They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions.
3,1,He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).
3,1,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7)"
3,1,"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom  applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works."
3,1,"In all cases before the Court, what is in issue is the international responsibility of the State"
3,1,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. "
3,1,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority. "
3,1,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).
3,1,"refer to domestic case-law as
indicating that  the relevant principle is well-established, accessible
and foreseeable in its application and consequences."
3,1,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions."
3,1,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
3,1,"The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above)."
3,1,"Further, they were unable to take
proceedings in Gibraltar since they were not eligible for legal aid and
had no other means of pursuing such proceedings."
3,1," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
3,1,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
3,1,"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law."
3,1,  It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law.
3,1,"In addition, the examination of the case has disclosed no circumstance which, according to the generally recognised principles of international law, might have absolved the applicant from raising these complaints during the cassation proceedings."
3,1,"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one."
3,1,"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,"
3,1,"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public."
3,1,"The Inspectors described Lonrho and the Fayed brothers as ""bitterly antagonistic parties"" (see paragraph 19 in fine above)."
3,1,"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it."
3,1,"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35)."
3,1," The Government contended that the rule relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies was clearly established in international law and in the case-law of the Convention organs,"
3,1,"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43)."
3,1,  It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.
3,1,"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability"
3,1,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
3,1,It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.
3,1,"Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision."
3,1,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
3,1,It is evident from the facts established by the national courts
3,1,The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).
3,1,"The case could have been looked at differently, both in domestic law and subsequently under the Convention."
3,1,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
3,1," As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go."
3,1,"A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity."
3,1,it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.
3,1,"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision (art. 64)."
3,1,"Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as ""the rules of natural justice"" (see paragraph 39 above)."
3,1,"The Government point out that any
complaint lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is
subject to comprehensive review."
3,1,"As regards more specifically investigations under the Companies Act, the British courts have explained that ""the public interest demands"" that ""Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness"" (per Lord Denning in re Pergamon Press Ltd - see paragraph 43 above)."
3,1,It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.
3,1,"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d))."
3,1,The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.
3,1,It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).
3,1,"The applicant argued that he had been humiliated and treated like a common criminal despite the fact that he had been a law-abiding citizen, a member of parliament and an advocate for about 40 years, with an unblemished record."
3,1,"  Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
3,1," Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
3,1,"On the other hand, the administrative authorities found, in order to bring the applicant's case within the ambit of section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, that that alcohol level had been attained."
3,1," The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a
violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention."
3,1,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
3,1," A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable."
3,1,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
3,1,"The grounds on which judicial review may be sought (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) are such that it would not have ensured access to a court for determination of the truth of statements made about the applicants in the Inspectors’ report, the absence of such access being the essence of their complaints under the Convention."
3,1,"The Government point out that any appeal
lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to
comprehensive review."
3,1,"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious
issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which
should depend on an examination of the merits."
3,1,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
3,1,"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention. "
3,1,In this respect the Government assert that the powers exercised by the police while the applicant was in their custody did not exceed the margin of appreciation conferred on States by the Convention.
3,1,The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).
3,1,the Court emphasised that the application of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. 
3,1," For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax."
3,1,"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 15 above). "
3,1,"Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above)."
3,1,"Thus, they
conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings
being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that
if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may
nevertheless be convicted under these. "
3,1,"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).  "
3,1,It certainly goes too far. 4.
3,1,"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
3,1,"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there)."
3,1,"It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"
3,1," For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax."
3,1,"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. "
3,1,"The Commission considers that the applicants' complaints under
Article 2 (Art. 2) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and
law, the determination of which should depend on the merits."
3,1,"This right to a court ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law;"
3,1,"Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law."
3,1,"Thus, they cannot, on arguable grounds, claim
to have a ""right"" under domestic law."
3,1,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
3,1,"Some of these decisions concern cases in which the State Council has ordered the prosecution of public officials for ill-treating people in custody, despite the initial view of the local administrative council that the cases were unsuitable for criminal proceedings."
3,1,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
3,1,The Court endorses in this respect the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Offutt v. USA (348 U.S. 11. 75 S.Ct.11):
3,1,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions. "
3,1,"""According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’"", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned."
3,1,"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention."
3,1,"As to the contested limitation on the ability to take legal proceedings, it was common ground that any defamation action brought by the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State would have been successfully met with a defence of privilege, be it absolute or qualified (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above)."
3,1,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
3,1, In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.
3,1,Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.
3,1,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below. "
3,1,"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. "
3,1,"The applicant submits that, although domestic law categorises the proceedings at issue in the present case as civil, both the nature of the proceedings and the actual penalty imposed indicate that a criminal charge was in fact determined."
3,1,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
3,1,Legislative Decree no. 285 on the state of emergency region transferred the power to carry out investigations into criminal acts allegedly committed by civil servants from the public prosecutors to the administrative councils (see paragraph 26 above).
3,1,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
3,1,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
3,1,since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.
3,1,"Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options.
41.   The Commission noted that the injuries that were or could be caused by the applicants’ activities were of a significant nature and degree, and that the conduct in question was, on any view, of an extreme character."
3,1,The impugned measures thus had a basis in domestic law.
3,1,"They consider that United Kingdom law is vague and
general and therefore is in itself in violation of this provision."
3,1,"Moreover, it is clear from the judgment of the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."
3,1,"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole. "
3,1,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
3,1," Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above)."
3,1,"In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65)."
3,1,"It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46)."
3,1,"The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. "
3,1,"In any event, like the Court of Appeal, the Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present case (see paragraph 30 above)."
3,1,"The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above)."
3,1," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
3,1,"This was, albeit in a different context, the view expressed by the Divisional Court in its judgment of 20 April 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh - see paragraph 24 above)."
3,1,"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one. "
3,1,"Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive."
3,1,"Furthermore, prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of serious ill treatment, which, as stated above (paragraph 62), is prohibited by the Convention in absolute and non-derogable terms."
3,1,"The applicant's submissions do not disclose any special
circumstance which might have absolved her according to the generally
recognised rules of international law from exhausting the effective
domestic remedies at her disposal.
"
3,1,We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.
3,1,His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).
3,1,"Thus, the decision of the court martial was not effective until ratified by him, and he had the power to vary the sentence imposed as he saw fit (see paragraph 48 above). This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of ""tribunal"" and can also be seen as a component of the ""independence"" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45)."
3,1,"In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them""."
3,1,"The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above)."
3,1,"He has
not therefore exhausted the remedies available to him under Swedish law
in respect of these complaints."
3,1,"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above)."
3,1,"They add, in this respect, that although the offence for which the applicant was convicted under Section 99 (1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (refusing to take a breath test) was not, as such, in force on the date of the reservation,  the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users and to pay such attention as is required for the maintenance of order, safety and traffic efficiency.
"
3,1,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
3,1,the limitations on rights and remedies created by the state of emergency;
3,1," In both the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal the applicant, who, in his appeal on points of law, put forward arguments which were based solely on domestic law and did not raise the matter of freedom of expression (see paragraph 17 above), merely defended himself against the charge of disturbing the peace, contrary to Article 192 of the Criminal Code. "
3,1,From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.
3,1," In Mr Palaoro's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a ""criminal charge"".  "
3,1,"The applicant does not dispute the existence of a legal basis for his conviction, but he maintains that the conviction and punishment inflicted upon him were without any legitimate purpose"
3,1,"Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the ""declaration"" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not ""criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure"" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this."
3,1,The Court has also taken note of the evidence submitted by the applicants showing that there is a body of informed opinion in the United Kingdom which believes that these consequences of the system enacted by Parliament in the Companies Act 1985 are not desirable.
3,1,They therefore drew the Court’s attention to the existence of an administrative remedy under Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution (see paragraph 27 above).
3,1,since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable.
3,1,"However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in Turkish law he was under a duty to investigate (see paragraph 26 above)."
3,1,"The applicants
have not therefore exhausted the remedies available to them under
Swedish law."
3,1, The purported remedies were thus ineffective for the following reasons:
3,1,"However, in this context it is not normally within the province of the Court to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them"
3,1,"In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence."
3,1,"The latter were different in nature and pursued different aims: whereas Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code punished homicide committed while under the influence of drink, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act punished the mere fact of driving a vehicle while intoxicated."
3,1," The
Constitutional Court, in its decision of 28 November 1989, declared the
applicant's complaint about the alleged insults committed by police
officers in the course of her detention inadmissible in accordance with
its constant case-law, according to which mere insults as such did not
amount to an administrative act relating to the exercise of direct
administrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting remarks
were allegedly made in the course of an official act."
3,1,It reiterates that the supervision machinery set up by the Convention is subsidiary to the national human rights protection systems.
3,1,"It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.  "
3,1,"It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
3,1,"Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape. "
3,1,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
3,1,"In the present case, inasmuch as the new proceedings reached their conclusion in a decision later in date than the entry into force of Protocol No. 7 (P7), namely the Administrative Court's judgment of 29 March 1989,"
3,1,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 22 above)."
3,1,"The Government underline that
the offence of causing death under the influence of drink contained in
Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code is different in character from
the provision of Section 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act"
3,1,"It considers
that the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law the
determination of which should depend on an examination on the merits."
3,1,"Further, the designation system which discriminates against gypsies prevents her moving onto unoccupied land or stationing her caravans near the highway."
3,1,"In any event, the whole issue of the role of consent in the criminal law is of great complexity and the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options."
3,1,"Obviously, it has often been pointed out that the Court's case-law has evolved considerably since the Convention came into force. "
3,1,"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence"
3,1, In its report referred to in paragraph 4 of the Court's judgment Helsinki Watch suggests that the incidents were rather the work of the majority!
3,1,"It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, the States have gone beyond the ""extent strictly required by the exigencies"" of the crisis."
3,1,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
3,1,"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties'
submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under
the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an
examination of the merits of the application as a whole. The Commission
concludes, therefore, that the application is not manifestly ill-
founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the
Convention."
3,1,  The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
3,1," In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, but the final decision as to observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court."
3,1,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
3,1,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 21 above)."
3,1,Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above).
3,1,"The applicant in this respect considers that the limitation of the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction by Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution does not meet the requirements of the reservation, even if it applies."
3,1,These are legitimate considerations which go to explain and justify the manner in which the entry into and search of the applicants’ home were carried out.
3,1,"It seemed to me necessary to expand paragraph 43 by noting ""to regulate and punish practices of sexual abuse that are demeaning even if they do not involve the infliction of physical harm""."
3,1,From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court.
3,1,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
3,1,"They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII)."
3,1,"He
points out that both criminal and administrative authorities apply a
level of 0.8 per mille as constituting a state of inebriation.
"
3,1,"“We continue to believe that what Mr Kyprianou said, the content, the manner and the tone of his voice, constitute a contempt of Court as provided in Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law 14/60”."
3,1,"as
it is not clear whether it covers double or multiple convictions only
by the Austrian criminal courts, or double or multiple convictions by
Austrian criminal courts on the one hand and Austrian administrative
criminal authorities on the other."
3,1,The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).
3,1,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied. "
3,1,"The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail."
3,1,"The court proceedings involving three courts and two oral
hearings thus lasted less than one and a half year."
3,1,"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the applicant considers that the enlarged grounds for
non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint are in any event at
variance with Convention requirements."
3,1,"The
competence of the Constitutional Court to receive complaints about the
violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights is limited under S. 144
para. 1 of the Federal Constitution to formal decisions of
administrative authorities or the exercise of direct administrative
authority and coercion against a particular individual."
3,1," By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of the derogations necessary to avert it."
3,1,"As a general rule, however, it is for the
domestic courts to assess the evidence before them, in particular since
they have the benefit of hearing witnesses and assessing their
credibility"
3,1,"The Court considers that the present proceedings can clearly be distinguished from the custody proceedings, as they concerned merely the fixing of maintenance payments and were not particularly complex. "
3,1,"“The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.”"
3,1,"Since ""the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court."
3,1,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction. "
3,1,"The Government contend
that having regard to the margin of appreciation, accorded to
Contracting States, there is no ground on which the Commission in its
supervisory jurisdiction can substitute its own opinion for that of the
courts."
3,1,"A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31)."
3,1," In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although that provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the possibility for the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural limitation and not a substantive one."
3,1,"The Act confers on the Inspectors wide powers to obtain information and obstruction of the Inspectors may, upon reference by them to a court, be treated by it as a contempt of court and punished accordingly (sections 434 and 436 of the Act - see paragraph 38 above)."
3,1,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
3,1,"that a thorough
examination of this complaint is required, both as to the law and as
to the facts."
3,1,"On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166)."
3,1,"It is therefore to be regarded as a sentence fixed by law
in respect of the gravity of the offence concerned."
3,1,"Moreover, an examination of the complaint does not
disclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have
absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules
of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedy at their
disposal."
3,1,"In addition, the examination of the case has disclosed no circumstance which, according to the generally recognised principles of international law, might have absolved the applicant from raising these complaints during the cassation proceedings."
3,1,"Article 27 of the Convention (art. 27) requires a flexible interpretation without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72), a ""pro victima"" approach in favour of admissibility in order to allow the Convention institutions to consider the alleged complaints. 
"
3,1,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
3,1,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
3,1,The Court notes that the charges of assault were numerous and referred to illegal activities which had taken place over more than ten years.
3,1,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
3,1," Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
3,1,Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.
3,1,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
3,1,"The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose."
3,1,"But there is one important distinction to be made. While this evolution is normal - subject to the necessary precautions being taken - with regard to the Convention's substantive provisions, it can only be exceptional and limited with regard to the procedural provisions such as the fundamental rule of international law that domestic remedies must be exhausted."
3,1,"The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye-witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 109, ECHR 1999 IV)."
3,1, The Court emphasises that its approach to the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. 
3,1,"The Commission considers that the applicant's complaints under
Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and
law, the determination of which should depend on a full examination of
the merits."
3,1,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
3,1,The Court considers that this treatment was of such a serious and cruel nature that it can only be described as torture.
3,1,That provision (P7-4) does not therefore apply before new proceedings have been opened.
3,1,"the restrictive scope of judicial
review"
3,1," Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
3,1,"The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the parties. It considers that the applicant's complaint raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. "
3,1,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions. "
3,1,"Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above)."
4,4,"He stated that there was a policy on the part of the State authorities of denying that torture ever took place, which made it extremely difficult for victims to succeed in receiving compensation and in having those responsible brought to justice."
4,4,"Furthermore, although Mr and Mrs Gül are lawfully resident in Switzerland, they do not have a permanent right of abode, as they do not have a settlement permit but merely a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which could be withdrawn, and which under Swiss law does not give them a right to family reunion (see paragraph 18 above). "
4,4," implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve "
4,4,"Moreover, up to his
placement in public care the third and the fourth applicant were
significantly involved in the everyday upbringing of the second
applicant."
4,4,He also maintains that his conviction and the penal sanctions inflicted upon him were not necessary in a democratic society.
4,4," There is little or no evidence for the Government's thesis on the long-range policy of secession which they see behind the impugned use of the designation ""Turkish""."
4,4,"Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the ""co-operative"" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal."
4,4,During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment (see paragraph 23 above).
4,4,It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked.
4,4,"Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention."
4,4,"Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the ""necessity"" of the interference."
4,4," The Court considers, in the light of all the material before it, that the particular extent and impact of PKK terrorist activity in South-East Turkey has undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a ""public emergency threatening the life of the nation"" "
4,4,"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention."
4,4,By then they have formed new social ties there and have definitively begun to adapt themselves to their new homeland.
4,4,"On the other hand, it supports the opinion that the media too can be obliged to take a clear stand in the area of racial discrimination and hatred."
4,4,The application principally concerns torture and inhuman conditions of detention.
4,4,That possibility is all the more real because Ersin has always lived there and has therefore grown up in the cultural and linguistic environment of his country.
4,4,"As for the question
whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in
pursuance of the above aims, the Commission observes that the second
applicant has been allowed to spend one weekend a month in the home of
the third and the fourth applicant, his paternal grandparents, while
being allowed to spend another weekend a month in the home of his
maternal grandparents."
4,4,"Where there is an arguable claim that an individual has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment, or deprived of his or her life, by agents of the State, Article 13 requires, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the treatment in question or the deprivation of life, including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (Salman, cited above, § 121)."
4,4,"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 23 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"")."
4,4,"The second is that the applicant’s wife is dependent on medical care which she can certainly get in Switzerland, whilst it is in debate to what extent, if at all, she will be able to get it in Turkey."
4,4,The needs of democracy justify transparency in such matters.
4,4,"Indeed, they pointed out that the applicant had already been suffering from retinopathy for two years before his imprisonment (since December 1998), and that it was not uncommon for diabetic retinopathy to develop over time to include macular oedema."
4,4,"Mr Gül had left Turkey when his younger son Ersin was three months old, and had never attempted to develop a family life in his country of origin."
4,4,who was detained over a long period of time.
4,4,"the respondent Government did not dispute the existence and ""civil"" character of the right under English law to a good reputation."
4,4,"The discriminatory element derives, inter alia, from the
fact that in England and Wales, contrary to the practice in Northern
Ireland, all detained persons, including those detained under
prevention of terrorism legislation, are permitted to have their legal
representative present during the police interviews."
4,4,"Moreover, it finds that, in view of the serious nature of the complaints and their connection with the general situation in South-East Turkey,"
4,4,"The present case concerns not only family life but also immigration, and the extent of a State’s obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest."
4,4,"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment)."
4,4,"Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the ""reputation or rights of others""."
4,4,"Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. "
4,4,Detained persons are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.
4,4,"The first and the second applicant complain that the first
applicant was prohibited from taking the second applicant home on his
release from his pre-trial detention,"
4,4,"By leaving Turkey in 1983, Mr Gül caused the separation from his son, and he was unable to prove to the Swiss authorities - who refused to grant him political refugee status - that he personally had been a victim of persecution in his home country."
4,4,"The Commission considers that the access restrictions now at
issue amounted - and amount - to an interference with the third and the
fourth applicant's ""family life""."
4,4,"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above). "
4,4,"Assuming
that this provision applies, the Commission observes that under Section
73 of the Social Services Act the third and the fourth applicant had
a right to challenge the Social Council's refusal before the
administrative courts."
4,4,"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State."
4,4,"The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain
medication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical
supervision at a hospital."
4,4,It is in the first place for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual’s interest in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the community’s interest in independent investigation of the affairs of large public companies. 
4,4,"Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme."
4,4,Their daughter Nursal was placed from birth in a home in Switzerland and has remained there ever since (see paragraph 9 above).
4,4,"The Court now holds that the applicable principles are similar, adding that in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community"
4,4,The order of 9 July in addition referred to Article 282 which specifically makes it an offence for a public servant to abuse his or her power in order to obtain such advantage (see paragraphs 9 and 28 above).
4,4,"In addition, according to the Government, by virtue of a social security convention concluded on 1 May 1969 between Switzerland and Turkey, the applicant could continue to receive his ordinary invalidity pension and half of the supplementary benefit he receives at present in respect of his wife, his son Ersin and his daughter Nursal if he returned to his home country (see paragraph 23 above)."
4,4,"However, after obtaining a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in Switzerland in 1990, the applicant asked the Swiss authorities for permission to bring the boy, who was then six years old, to Switzerland (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). "
4,4,"The only reason why, in the Court of Cassation, the applicant had asserted his right to use the term ""Turkish"" to designate the Muslims of Western Thrace had been to prove that the act he had committed was not sufficient to make out the objective element of the offence defined in Article 192 of the Criminal Code."
4,4,The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system.
4,4,"Rightly so, for, generally speaking, it may be assumed that after a period of between three and five years immigrants become rooted in the country of settlement."
4,4,He stresses the key role played by freedom of expression in a democratic society. 
4,4,"On the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word ""life"" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence."
4,4,"They submit that Section 10 of the 1981 Act
gives recognition to the high public importance of protecting the free
flow of information to the press and provides a heavy presumption
against ordering disclosure."
4,4,Another key group in guaranteeing effective investigation and protection is the medical profession.
4,4,She submits that there is an acknowledged shortfall of sites for gypsies in South Cambridgeshire and that local authorities are failing to fulfil their statutory duty to provide sites.
4,4, since as a matter of fact she was and is able to live either on the neighbouring land lawfully occupied by her sister or to apply for a place on one of the many other local authority and private gipsy caravan sites throughout Cambridgeshire.
4,4,"Furthermore, the ""conditions of extreme tension"", as Lord Griffiths put it in his speech in the House of Lords, under which such arrests in Northern Ireland have to be carried out must be recognised."
4,4,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here"
4,4,"In this respect the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing
rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and
illusory"
4,4,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicant, because"
4,4,"Indeed, it was not contended before the Convention institutions that the funds had not been received by the States concerned."
4,4,"The applicant relied on medical reports which revealed that his condition had been stable for a long period (since 1998) but, immediately after his imprisonment, he had suffered serious complications."
4,4,"  In view of the length of time Mr and Mrs Gül have lived in Switzerland, it would admittedly not be easy for them to return to Turkey, but there are, strictly speaking, no obstacles preventing them from developing family life in Turkey."
4,4,"Furthermore, his position in society, his numerous contacts abroad and his repeated requests that the authorities return his passport, were all considerations which went to justify placing him in pre-trial detention."
4,4,"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above)."
4,4,He referred to medical evidence from Dicle University Medical Faculty which showed that he was suffering from a bilateral brachial plexus injury at the time of his admission to hospital (see paragraph 19 above).
4,4,"It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment."
4,4,"In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued."
4,4,"Any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate
and ineffective since, inter alia, the operation in question in this
case was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the
State and having regard, inter alia, to the situation in South-East
Turkey which is such that potential applicants have a well-founded fear
of the consequences if they should pursue remedies."
4,4,"Twice he had to undergo
treatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital."
4,4,it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated.
4,4," The Government further submit that the interference was
""necessary in a democratic society"""
4,4,"The certificates issued by the Secretary
of State were however conclusive of the fact that the alleged liability
did not arise in respect of the Government in the United Kingdom or in
Northern Ireland and effectively put an end to the proceedings."
4,4,"Moreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.  "
4,4,"The system contributes to safeguarding the interests of the various parties concerned in the affairs of public companies such as investors, shareholders, especially small shareholders, creditors, customers, trading partners and employees, as well as ensuring the overall soundness and credibility of the country’s company law structures."
4,4, The Commission considers that this indicates an issue falling within the scope of freedom of expression.
4,4,"  The exercice of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime ...""."
4,4,"As appears from the case-law supplied to the Court, a constituent element of the offence of misappropriation under Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code was that the offender had sought to obtain for himself or herself or for a third party an advantage (see paragraph 26 above)."
4,4,"Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe."
4,4,"This has been confirmed by such bodies as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which, in its public statement of 15 December 1992, concluded that the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in Turkey, and that such methods are applied to both ordinary criminal suspects and persons held under anti-terrorist provisions (p. 6 para. 21)."
4,4, an administrative practice of torture in Turkish detention centres;
4,4,In this respect he referred to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s Public Statement on Turkey (15 December 1992); the United Nations Committee against Torture’s Summary Account of the Results of the Proceedings Concerning the Inquiry on Turkey (9 November 1993); and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture’s Report of 1995 
4,4,"However,
the existence of ""family life"" will depend on a number of factors and
on the particular circumstances of each case (cf., e.g., No. 12763/87,
Dec. 14.7.88, D.R. 57 p. 216)."
4,4,Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material
4,4,"Finally, they raised a number of points relating to the medical evidence, including the facts that the applicant took his medical records with him when he left hospital and that there was no medical evidence of burns or other marks left by the application of electric shocks."
4,4,"since it included the threat to the
applicant of up to two years' imprisonment and has cast a
disproportionate chilling effect on the free flow of information to the
public generally.
"
4,4,"True, as the Court recognised in the Berrehab judgment, subsequent events may break such a family life relationship, but only exceptional circumstances can warrant the conclusion that the tie between a parent and his or her child is severed."
4,4,The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences
4,4,"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention."
4,4,"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive."
4,4,Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.
4,4,In 1990 Mr and Mrs Gül were granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and then sought permission to bring their son Ersin to Switzerland.
4,4,The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs.
4,4,that the applicants’ sado-masochistic activities involved a significant degree of injury or wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or transient.
4,4,"It is furthermore established that the burden of
proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies
lies upon the State invoking the rule "
4,4," In addition, this failure prejudiced his chances of victory in civil or administrative proceedings, because in order to succeed with either type of claim it would have been necessary to prove that he had suffered torture, and in practice a ruling to that effect by a judge in criminal proceedings would have been required."
4,4,an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces;
4,4,"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 21 and 23 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose."
4,4,"The first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind."
4,4,"In fact, Mr Aksoy could have had recourse to three different types of domestic remedy: a criminal prosecution, a civil action and/or administrative proceedings (see paragraphs 24-28 above)."
4,4,"These reports were prepared by numerous medical
experts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist."
4,4,"The second applicant is the child of the first applicant in his
marriage to S. The first and the second applicant therefore constitute
a ""family"" ipso jure"
4,4,"At the hearing the Government’s representative also identified three other kinds of more specific ""objective evidence"", namely the conviction of the first applicant’s brothers, her contacts with them and her visits to America."
4,4,Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.
4,4,"The applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views."
4,4,"It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time."
4,4,They also found it suspicious that he had waited for five days between being released from police custody and contacting the hospital (see paragraph 19 above) and observed that it could not be assumed that nothing untoward had occurred in the meantime.
4,4, In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation
4,4,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether
there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish
authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by
the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not
been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies
under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints."
4,4,"In the words of the Commission’s report (at paragraph 64), ""it is ... necessary in a democratic society that governments exercise supervisory controls over large commercial activities in order to ensure good management practices and the transparency of honest dealings""."
4,4,"""the case concerns important national issues and also raises complex legal problems, since it affects the Muslim minority in Western Thrace"". "
4,4,Ersin has always lived in Turkey (see paragraph 19 above). 
4,4,Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.
4,4," In support of their submission, the applicants alleged that all those involved in the sado-masochistic encounters were willing adult participants; that participation in the acts complained of was carefully restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities; that the acts were not witnessed by the public at large and that there was no danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed; that no serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no infection had been caused to the wounds, and that no medical treatment had been required."
4,4,The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the fundamental values of a democratic society.
4,4,"The difference in this respect between the position in
England and Wales and that in Northern Ireland, based as it was solely
on the geographical location at which a person was arrested and
detained,"
4,4,"Thus, they lasted for more than eight years and five months."
4,4," The Commission cannot find that the second applicant's placement
in the ""family home"" and the related access restrictions amount to a
deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 (Art. 5) of
the Convention."
4,4,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether
there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish
authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by
the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not
been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies
under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints."
4,4,"Mrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic, since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds."
4,4,"the domestic classification of the offence, b) the nature of the offence, and c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring,"
4,4,"However, before the County
Administrative Court the other applicants gave reason to believe that
they would discontinue this therapy if the second applicant's public
care were to be revoked."
4,4,"He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background."
4,4,A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.
4,4,"Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous."
4,4,since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.
4,4,"since she has not applied to the Secretary of State to exercise his power under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to direct a local authority to comply with its statutory duty to provide such sites and if necessary, to enforce such directions in the courts."
4,4,"For example, it was now impossible for individuals alleging torture to obtain medical reports proving the extent of their injuries, because the forensic medical service had been reorganised and doctors who issued such reports were either threatened or moved to a different area."
4,4,"In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the State authorities were entitled to have regard not only to the actual seriousness of the harm caused - which as noted above was considered to be significant - but also, as stated by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (see paragraph 21 above), to the potential for harm inherent in the acts in question."
4,4,"In addition, he contended that the conditions in which he was detained (see paragraph 13 above) and the constant fear of torture which he suffered while in custody amounted to inhuman treatment."
4,4,Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey.
4,4,"Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
4,4,"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above)."
4,4,The underlying aim of this system is clearly the furtherance of the public interest in the proper conduct of the affairs of public companies whose owners benefit from limited liability.
4,4,"Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (ibid.)."
4,4,"The English legal system, in their view, lacked adequate safeguards to protect their civil right to honour and reputation against misuse of their powers by the Inspectors and the Secretary of State."
4,4,The length of the deprivation of liberty at risk may also be material to the level of suspicion required.
4,4,"in that, as a result, the second
applicant was kept in public care."
4,4,"On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49)."
4,4,"It further considered that implementation of
the public care in the third and the fourth applicant's home could lead
to a conflict of interests jeopardising the care, given the other
applicants' objections to the therapy provided as well as the third and
the fourth applicant's belief that the first applicant was innocent."
4,4," In assessing the humaneness of the choice with which the Swiss authorities confronted the applicant and his wife this element, the fact that they have become integrated in their new homeland - an element which, incidentally, is closely connected with their private life - is of far more importance than the formal status of their permit."
4,4,"The Secretary of State's power under section 9 is, she contends, discretionary and rarely exercised."
4,4,"They did not, however, avail themselves of this
opportunity."
4,4," Further, the
applicant considers that there was no pressing social need for the
restraint,"
4,4,"Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter
alia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was
brought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious
diseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with
any particular illness while in hospital."
4,4,In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).
4,4,"  On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the
applicant's state of ill-health."
4,4," In fact, in the present case, some of these acts could well be compared to ""genital torture"" and a Contracting State could not be said to have an obligation to tolerate acts of torture because they are committed in the context of a consenting sexual relationship."
4,4,"There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective ""respect"" for family life."
4,4,"It is furthermore established that the burden of
proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies
lies upon the State invoking the rule"
4,4,"Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons."
4,4,"According to the applicant, the order has a chilling effect
on the likelihood of sources communicating information to journalists
such as himself, and his right to impart information to the public has
also been impaired thereby."
4,4,They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.
4,4,"Furthermore, the fact that Mr and Mrs Gül’s daughter Nursal had been placed in a home in Switzerland showed that they were in any event incapable of assuming their parental responsibilities with regard to the boy. "
4,4,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
4,4,"because of the short duration of the detention,"
4,4,Nor is there a scrap of evidence for the assertion that there is a direct or even an indirect causal link between the impugned terminology in the pamphlet of October 1989 and the violence and disorder of 29 January 1990.
4,4,"The question is one of proportionality or balance between the public and the individual interests.
"
4,4,since they concerned the name and cultural identity of an entire minority.
4,4,"Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
4,4,We give him this opportunity exceptionally. 
4,4,"It
notes, in particular, that in its judgment of 15 September 1993  the
Administrative Court of Appeal examined the first applicant's criticism
of the conditions in the second applicant's ""family home"" in order to
assess whether his public care should be implemented somewhere else."
4,4,"The applicants in those
proceedings (in respect of which they were granted legal aid by the
relevant domestic authorities) intended, inter alia, to argue that
liability arose out of the actions of Crown agents based in the United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland."
4,4, The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements.
4,4,In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.
4,4,"In this respect, acts of torture - such as those in issue in the present case - may be banned also on the ground that they undermine the respect which human beings should confer upon each other."
4,4,It has held in its earlier judgments that an unacknowledged detention would be life-threatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993
4,4,  The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.
4,4,"The Commission finds no indication that the first applicant has
challenged the access restrictions at issue by appealing against the
Social Council's care plan to the administrative courts."
4,4,The third is that the mere fact that the Turkish authorities did not immediately arrest the applicant when he entered the country as a visitor does not imply that he would not get into trouble if he tried to settle there again on a permanent basis.
4,4,"Special arrangements have apparently been made
for public holidays."
4,4,"The respondent Government, both in that case and the present case, submitted to the Commission in the first place and later to the European Court - both in their memorial and at the public hearing - dozens of judgments of the courts of first instance or the supreme courts such as the Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court.
7.   Most of these judgments concerned cases in south-eastern Turkey where acts of terrorism are being committed and where the present case occurred. The following examples give a brief summary of some of these decisions."
4,4,"Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice."
4,4,"Moreover, the
term ""international investigation or settlement"" refers to institutions
and procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental
bodies.
"
4,4,The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination probably does not require the punishment of journalists responsible for a television spot of this kind.
4,4,"Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his
detention was spent in hospital."
4,4,"for the purpose of protecting the
rights of others and for preventing the disclosure of information
received in confidence."
4,4," He complains in particular that
the authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of
various medical experts;  as a result, his health seriously
deteriorated."
4,4,"Indeed, when preparing their reports,
the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health
of the years 1988-1990."
4,4,"Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance."
4,4,"Since
the police have similar powers to delay access in England and Wales,"
4,4,"In addition, the focus of that son’s family life was in Turkey since, even after his mother’s departure, the child had been taken in as a member of his elder brother’s family.  "
4,4,"She was, moreover, able to visit Turkey with her husband in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
4,4,"That principle is reflected in the rule set forth in Article 26 (art. 26), which ""dispenses States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system"""
4,4,They had not benefited any members of the government or any third parties; the funds had been received in their entirety by the addressee countries.
4,4,"It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec. 11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102)."
4,4,"It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."
4,4,"In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended."
4,4,"Thus, they lasted more than nine years and four months. "
4,4,The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.
4,4,"The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland."
4,4,Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable.
4,4,"Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary."
4,4,"They were unable to pursue
proceedings in the High Court in Northern Ireland since the
certificates excluded the jurisdiction of the courts."
4,4,"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49)."
4,4, The Commission considers that this indicates an issue falling within the scope of freedom of expression.
4,4,The absence of any indication about the approximate positions of the person who fired and the victim and the distance between them at the moment of the shot as well as the size of the bullet entry and exit wounds constitute important deficiencies.
4,4,"As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above)."
4,4,"The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility."
4,4, It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith.
4,4," However, none of the provisions of the Criminal Code relied on to justify the detention - Articles 201 to 203, 219 and 282 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) - specified or even implied that anyone could incur criminal liability by taking part in collective decisions of this nature."
4,4,Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.
4,4,because of his detention.
4,4,  Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-3) provides for free elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.
4,4," In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the
applicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital
environment."
4,4,"It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded."
4,4,"At one stage he was even brought to
the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute."
4,4,"In respect of
alleged ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention,
the Commission has held that raising criminal charges against the
officials concerned or filing a civil action for compensation are
effective remedies to be exhausted pursuant to Article 26 (Art. 26)
(No. 11208/84, Dec. 4.3.86, D.R. 46 p. 182; No. 10078/82, Dec.
13.12.84, D.R. 41 p. 103; No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57)."
4,4,"The applicant left Turkey in 1983 and made his way to Switzerland, where he applied for political asylum; this application was rejected by the Minister for Refugees in 1989 (see paragraph 10 above)."
4,4,"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion."
4,4,"Articles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code, which were in force throughout Turkey, penalised the use of torture and ill-treatment for the extraction of confessions (see paragraph 24 above)."
4,4,The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.
4,4,"In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention."
4,4,The Commission notes that in the context of the section 9 powers the Secretary of State has a very wide discretion.
4,4,"In particular, they refer to Section 41 (2) 3 (a)-(c) of the
Administrative Court Act under which the Administrative Court must
quash an authority's decision for violation of procedural rules where
in an essential point the authority has found facts in a way which
contradicts the file,  where the facts require complementation in an
essential point, or where procedural provisions have been disregarded
in circumstances where, had they been observed, the authority could
have arrived at a different decision."
4,4,It follows that neither have I been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were necessary in a democratic society. 
4,4,"In particular, he argued that reports by a number of international bodies showing that the torture of detainees continued to be systematic and widespread in Turkey raised questions about the commitment of the State to bringing an end to this practice."
4,4,Everyone has the right to the freedom of expression.
4,4,"the ""protection of the reputation or rights of others""."
4,4,"Article 3 (art. 3), as the Court has observed on many occasions, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society."
4,4,If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.
4,4,"Everyone has the right to respect for his private
... life ...

2.	There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."""
4,4,"In this context the
Commission recalls that they were found eligible under the financial
criteria for legal aid in Northern Ireland and before the Commission
itself."
4,4,"The ""general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities"" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection."
4,4,"The Government emphasised that the decision of the Secretary of State to publish the report was not a decision directed against the applicants; it was a decision taken in the general public interest, including that of freedom of expression and information, having regard to the overall content of the report."
4,4,"indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed."
4,4,The rationale of this defence is that statements which harm an individual’s reputation and which would otherwise give rise to liability should benefit from total or partial immunity because their author or publisher is acting in furtherance of some overriding interest of social importance (see paragraph 42 above).
4,4,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  "
4,4,"since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining."
4,4,"However, no judicial authority in Greece was disposed to affirm that a member of the ""Turkish minority"" enjoyed such a right."
4,4,"Despite the distance, in geographical terms, between them, the applicant has made a number of visits to Turkey, the last of these being in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
4,4,"However, although her state of health seemed particularly alarming in 1987, when her accident occurred, it has not been proved that she could not later have received appropriate medical treatment in specialist hospitals in Turkey. "
4,4,The interest of the general public in being informed about matters of major public concern can best be served by the publication of the results of Government inquiries.
4,4,"The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (Orhan, cited above, § 326)."
4,4,"However, while basing his case on the narrower domestic criminal law provision of Article 192 of the Greek Penal Code, the applicant claimed the right to use the words ""Turk(s)"" or ""Turkish"" to identify the Moslems of Western Thrace."
4,4,"  In the Government’s submission, the defence of privilege delimited the very content of the applicants’ right to a good reputation as protected under English law."
4,4,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
4,4,"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest."
4,4,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  "
4,4,"It transpires
from these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic
lympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart."
4,4,"The situation regarding sanctions of a disciplinary nature, in the form of fines, imposed for behaviour which does not attract criminal liability, is different (Ravnsborg v. Sweden, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283‑B)."
4,4,"Moreover, his family had also been affected by the actions of the authorities insofar as his father and one of his brothers had been detained for short periods at about the same time, and the applicant himself was hospitalised for two weeks after his release."
4,4,"For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had
worse basic indicators of his blood count."
4,4,"He relied on Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides: 
""1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his ... family life ... 
2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" "
5,0," It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above)."
5,0,"   In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State. "
5,0,"Accordingly, a compensation request for police custody which lasted for eleven days would not succeed before the domestic courts."
5,0," An additional point to note as concerns the particular circumstances of the present case is that the findings in the Inspectors’ report to which the applicants took exception related to matters which the applicants themselves had made great efforts to bring into the public domain, namely their family background, their personal wealth and their business activities (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above)."
5,0, The Government argued that any loss of reputation and adverse publicity allegedly suffered by the applicant had been a consequence of his own unprofessional and offensive conduct rather than his conviction and imprisonment.
5,0," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
5,0,"Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about

the acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest."
5,0,The Court would firstly reiterate its recognition that the use of confidential information is essential in combating terrorist violence and the threat that organised terrorism poses to the lives of citizens and to democratic society as a whole
5,0," As regards the Inquest proceedings, the Government submit that
it provided an exhaustive fact-finding investigation by an independent
body."
5,0,"According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence"
5,0,"However an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public."
5,0,"because, inter alia, all the officers appointed to it were directly subordinate to the convening officer who also performed the role of prosecuting authority"
5,0,"Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest. "
5,0,The applicants have alleged that the publication of the report constituted a measure of control of the use of their property.
5,0,"Admittedly, the Prosecutor-General had not been in a position at the time to ascertain whether there was criminal intent."
5,0,"He
points to the lack of civilian judicial members of the court-martial,
the absence of guarantees against outside pressures and the ad hoc
nature of the appointment of the members of the court-martial."
5,0,It must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police custody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support.
5,0,The lack of legal qualification or experience in the officers making the decisions either at the court martial or review stages made it impossible for them to act in an independent or impartial manner.
5,0,"The very strong inferences drawn by the trial judge
in the applicant's case played a crucial role in his conviction."
5,0," In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above)."
5,0,"However, it is noted that the public prosecutor’s investigation was limited to taking statements from the three complainants."
5,0,"The applicants have submitted, inter alia, that English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case. The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation."
5,0," In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded."
5,0,"The burden of proof remained throughout on the
prosecution."
5,0,"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. "
5,0," The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44)."
5,0,"In addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76)."
5,0,In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers.
5,0,"In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because
""it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"",
which induces the Court to come to the conclusion that
""the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview""."
5,0,"He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those ""reasonably requested"" by the defence."
5,0,"It was suggested by the representative of the Government that ""primary facts"", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from ""something other than the primary facts or information""."
5,0,"Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive."
5,0,"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76)."
5,0,"In this respect, the Court is further struck by the refusal of the domestic authorities to deliver Mehmet Şah's body to his family, who intended to request a detailed autopsy."
5,0,"Lonrho admittedly exhibited a clear interest in the inquiry and its outcome, by being instrumental in bringing about the appointment of the Inspectors, by submitting evidence and by seeking to prompt action by the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 12 in fine, 13, 19, 24, 25 and 35 above)."
5,0,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions."
5,0,"Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26775/95, § 155, ECHR 2000-IV)."
5,0,"Furthermore, no complaint was ever made to the police - who learnt about the applicants’ activities by chance (see paragraph 8 above)."
5,0,"In my view all three are capable of satisfying the condition of an honest or genuine suspicion, but do not constitute ""at least some facts or information"" on which a reasonable suspicion could be based."
5,0," Limiting its examination of the fairness of the proceedings to
the first applicant's complaints 1 (h) and (o), the Commission observes
that he availed himself of his right to challenge Ms. Ekberg's report
by making a request to hear another expert."
5,0,"They point out that
the jury on consideration of the evidence found that the killings were
lawful."
5,0,"Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible."
5,0,"They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence."
5,0,"The authorities have thus failed to establish the real circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, who was under their custody."
5,0,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the
destruction of homes and property in villages and towns."
5,0,"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47)."
5,0," In the instant case the Court observes that the applicants were taken into custody, on suspicion of aiding and abetting the PKK and for being involved in the events which resulted in the killing of a police officer and the wounding of another."
5,0,The Court refers to its finding above where it has established that Mehmet Şah had died while he was under the control of the domestic authorities (see paragraph 65).
5,0,"Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition ""furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (see paragraph 51 above)."
5,0,The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements. 
5,0,"They
allege that there had been a lack of diligence in seeking out witnesses
and attempts made to intimidate and discredit those who did come
forward."
5,0,It therefore accepts the evidence of the four witnesses who stated that they had seen Mehmet Şah when they were themselves being held on the same premises.
5,0,"The decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time."
5,0,"The Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution"
5,0," Concerning the second applicant, the Court notes that a judge did not intervene until the end of his police custody, that is to say eleven days after his arrest."
5,0," In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 14 above)."
5,0,Even though they own the fourth applicant company no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward.
5,0,"Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government."
5,0,"In the applicants’ submission, one of the objects of the inquiry by the Inspectors was to make findings as to whether the applicants were guilty of misconduct and the central conclusion of the report was that the applicants had dishonestly misled the authorities."
5,0,"They did not make a legal determination as to criminal or civil liability concerning the Fayed brothers, and in particular concerning the latter’s civil right to honour and reputation."
5,0,"Both the TV presenter’s introduction and the applicant’s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of ""a group of extremist youths"" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them."
5,0," He considers that, whatever the nature of the proceedings, they were so complex as to require proper legal representation, especially regarding the alternatives to immediate imprisonment."
5,0," Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable."
5,0,"Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that it is undisputed that the applicant had, as a member of the Bulgarian Government, taken part in the decisions - granting funds in assistance and loans to certain developing countries - which had given rise to the charges against him."
5,0,Similar conclusions apply to the taking and retention of a photograph of Mrs Murray at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).
5,0,"Nor would the libel actions against The Observer, although to some extent concerned with the same subject-matter (see paragraph 11 above), have provided a remedy against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State as regards the publication of the damaging statements contained in the Inspectors’ report."
5,0,"The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above)."
5,0,"In correspondence with the authorities the applicants had previously been consistently threatening to take legal action to contest the report and its publication; yet in the event they did not do so, despite a formal undertaking on behalf of the Secretary of State to hold up publication if proceedings were brought (see paragraph 29 above)."
5,0," In respect of this second part of the domestic investigation, the Court considers that the authorities who were responsible for the investigation lacked the requisite independence and impartiality."
5,0,"Given that these circumstances do not disclose any indication
of a delay on the part of the applicant in introducing his application
once it must have become apparent that no redress for his complaints
was forthcoming, the Commission considers that the relevant date for
the purposes of the six months time limit should not be considered to
be a date earlier than February 1994."
5,0," It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous."
5,0,"On the other hand, the Court observes that the testimonies of Abdurrazak1, Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy, who were detained at the Rapid Intervention Force, were balanced, detailed and consistent with each other."
5,0,It is also clear from the witness testimonies that the Kulp District Gendarme Commander further delegated the Kulp Gendarme Station Commander to conduct the investigation. 
5,0,"The second Reviewing Authority did not
seek any such advice, and therefore a person without any legal
qualifications or advice made the final decision on the applicant's
petition against sentence."
5,0,"The Government were, however, not in a position to provide any details of such ""deals"" as it would adversely affect the confidentiality of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant and eight other former government members."
5,0,"The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so."
5,0,The remedy available to Mrs Murray would have satisfied these conditions.
5,0,"It is not possible to establish in detail what happened during the applicant's meeting with the public prosecutor, but the Commission finds no reason to doubt that during their conversation there were elements which should have made the public prosecutor initiate an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information from the applicant about his state of health or about the treatment to which he had been subjected."
5,0,The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise.
5,0,The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law.
5,0,"During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above)."
5,0,It notes that the applicants' allegations of torture are solely based on the assumption that some of the persons who were detained in the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters had heard the cries of Mehmet Şah.
5,0,"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority."
5,0," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
5,0,The Government maintained before the Commission that the applicant’s detention had been effected on the grounds of suspicion of his having committed a crime and had been in conformity with Bulgarian law.
5,0,"States enjoy a margin of appreciation in their decision whether to publish reports of the present kind, provided that the decision is not taken arbitrarily or with malice towards the particular individuals involved. "
5,0,"He maintained that the wide and adverse media coverage over a number of months had affected his own and his family’s life and reputation, as well as his professional and political career."
5,0," In this connection it is to be noted that the Government’s submission that there had been certain ""deals"" was found by the Commission to be unsubstantiated and was not reiterated before the Court."
5,0,"Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism."
5,0,"Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this."
5,0," As regards the applicants' submission concerning the effects of the events on themselves, the Court has no doubt of the profound suffering caused by the death of Mehmet Şah."
5,0,"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 15 above)."
5,0,by not having applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision to publish the Inspectors’ report;
5,0,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
5,0,"  On the basis of the evidence adduced in the present case, the Court has found that the Government are responsible under Article 2 of the Convention for the death of Mehmet Şah while he was under custody."
5,0,"Persons, such as the applicants, who fall into the former category of businessmen inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts, not only by the press but also and above all by bodies representing the public interest (ibid.)."
5,0," In arriving at their findings of fact or conclusions, the Inspectors were under a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they proposed to criticise in their report a fair opportunity to answer the allegations against them."
5,0,"However, only a few charges were selected for inclusion in the prosecution case."
5,0,The investigation into the affairs of HOFH and the publication of the resultant report in themselves therefore pursued legitimate aims.
5,0,"Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal."
5,0,"The respondent Government submit that detention at Her Majesty's
pleasure is to be equated with the term of mandatory life imprisonment
for adults and is in effect the equivalent sentence imposed on
juveniles."
5,0,"The Government have contended that the applicants could
have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly
proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for
them, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by
them during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in
respect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report."
5,0,"That being so, in the present case the Commission was unable to find any evidence to show that Mr Aksoy’s death was connected with his application, or that the State authorities had been responsible for any interference, in the form of threats or intimidation, with his rights under Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1), and no new evidence in this connection was presented to the Court."
5,0," In addition, the Court finds it significant that the convening officer also acted as ""confirming officer""."
5,0,"It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of ""promptness""."
5,0,"Likewise, no dispute (contestation) between the Secretary of State or the Inspectors and the applicants as to the lawfulness of any alleged interference with the applicants’ right to reputation arose merely because the applicants contested the grounds on which the Minister decided to appoint the Inspectors and on which the Inspectors conducted their lines of inquiry."
5,0,"Moreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge."
5,0,"The Government also submit that, in light of the importance of
discipline in the armed forces and in view of the seriousness of the
charges, the reasons for the sentence were obvious."
5,0,"On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern."
5,0," The Government also argue that the Judge Advocate must satisfy
himself that none of the members of the court-martial knows the accused
or has heard anything about the charges."
5,0,"The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as “prompt” for these purposes."
5,0,"The
Government also refer to the fact that the conduct of the Judge
Advocate was considered and found acceptable by the Divisional Court,
and submit that the prosecuting officer did all that was possible to
ensure the attendance of the relevant witness, including issuing a
witness summons."
5,0,"Without taking statements from the family members of the deceased who were also arrested that day or the police officers who were involved in the clash, the public prosecutor concluded that Mehmet Şah had died during a clash."
5,0,"Even though the Inspectors’ role may in theory have been investigative, the manner in which they performed their functions in the present case was in fact determinative."
5,0,Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray.
5,0,"This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest."
5,0,"In this respect, it should also be recalled that the applicants had brought to the public prosecutor's attention the possibility that Mehmet Şah could have been killed under torture. "
5,0,"In the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA."
5,0," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
5,0,"The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above):
""The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ... It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned."""
5,0,"the
applicant's conduct and that of the competent authorities), and having
regard to all the information in its possession"
5,0,"As regards the particular facts complained of by the applicant brothers, the Court accepts as accurate the Government’s analysis of the purposes served by the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report (see paragraphs 28 and 58 above - see also paragraphs 13, 14 and 30 above as regards the particular facts)."
5,0, It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations.
5,0,She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion.
5,0,It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers.
5,0,The essence of the case concerns the criticisms made in the Inspectors' report about the first three applicants and the effects of the report upon their honour and reputation.
5,0,"He also takes issue
with the limited sentencing regime available and the reasonableness of
the decisions reached in his case."
5,0,"His counsel, moreover, expressly confirmed this at the hearing. "
5,0,Before the Inspectors' report was published it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants.
5,0,"Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above)."
5,0,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the
destruction of homes and property in villages and towns."
5,0," In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that any defect in the proceedings of the Assize Court was cured on appeal by the Supreme Court."
5,0,"He was released after the Court of Appeal reviewed this sentence, reducing it to 15 months' imprisonment, convertible to a fine."
5,0,"The Court has found it established that the security forces deliberately destroyed the applicant’s house and property, obliging his family to leave their village (see paragraph 47 above). "
5,0,"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76)."
5,0," In any event, in their argument to the Court the applicants did not suggest that either the Inspectors or the successive Secretaries of State had acted with malicious intent, which would have destroyed a defence of qualified privilege."
5,0,"However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied)."
5,0,"Can one consider that adolescents taking part in sado-masochistic activities have given their free and informed consent where their elders have used various means of enticement, including financial reward?"
5,0,"The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D.
74.  The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested."
5,0,"He did not deny that the procedures identified by the Government are formally part of the Turkish legal structure, but he contended that the Government have not shown how such procedures could conceivably be effective for the specific circumstances of the present case."
5,0,"In fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand ""the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him""."
5,0,He was not a convicted prisoner or guilty of such undeserving conduct as to justify a refusal of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention; he had simply been defending his client in a murder trial.
5,0,"The
Government have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury

trial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore

had to withdrew the defamation proceedings against The Observer."
5,0,This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.
5,0,The public prosecutor appears to have excluded the possibility that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah could have been different than those stated in the incident report.
5,0,"However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be ""decisive"" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment)."
5,0,"A wider sentencing regime is not
possible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the
fact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving
member of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties."
5,0,"It followed that, although it was not possible to establish exactly what happened during his meeting with the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992, there must undoubtedly have been elements which should have prompted the latter to open an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information about the applicant’s state of health and the treatment to which he had been subjected."
5,0,"Although it was true that the allocation of development aid had not as such constituted a criminal offence, the charges in question had been brought because the transfers of funds had, under the cover of development assistance, involved improper ""deals"" causing damage to Bulgaria’s economic interests."
5,0,"The Government also submit that alleged arson, destruction of
property and threatening conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code,
in respect of which complaints could be lodged with the competent
authorities, civil or military.
"
5,0,"On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals."
5,0," Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the
 
applicants at all stages of the contents of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit. "
5,0,"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. "
5,0,"They had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth

applicant's affairs, and, in particular the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985."
5,0,"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above)."
5,0,"To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question."
5,0,"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification. It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of "
5,0," The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries
is not an offence under Bulgarian law. "
5,0,"In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court."
5,0," In addition, the Government dispute that the Convening Officer
controlled the proceedings through the prosecuting officer, and point
out that the applicant was represented by an experienced lawyer."
5,0,"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned."
5,0," The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness."
5,0," In the Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68 above), the Court held that the United Kingdom Government had not exceeded their margin of appreciation by derogating from their obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) to the extent that individuals suspected of terrorist offences were allowed to be held for up to seven days without judicial control."
5,0,"  In addition, the Government argued that Mr Aksoy could have brought a civil action for damages."
5,0,"The problem with these facts, as I see it, is that none of them per se may be held against the first applicant to incriminate her."
5,0,"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine)."
5,0,"Thereafter the applicants were at pains to stifle any publicity adverse to this favourable reputation which they had themselves largely created, as is shown by their threatened or actual libel actions against various newspapers, notably The Observer (see paragraph 11 above)."
5,0, where the facts constituting the offence were to be proved through witnesses.
5,0,"Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow."
5,0,"  The applicant contends that the disclosure order breached his
duty of confidentiality to his source and was not ""prescribed by law"","
5,0,The Government found the sum claimed excessive.
5,0,It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.
5,0,"The Government’s assertion that the judges who convicted the applicant cannot be considered complainants in the proceedings and had no personal interest in the relevant offence but were simply defending the authority and standing of the court is, in the opinion of the Court, theoretical."
5,0,"The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility"
5,0,"In addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers. "
5,0,"The Commission finds that the complaint relating to the
presumption of innocence was not made in the applicant's application
form or in correspondence with the Commission's Secretariat. "
5,0,"There is thus no indication
that there was in this respect a lack of ""equality of arms"" between the
first applicant and the prosecution."
5,0," Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers."
5,0," Even though the investigation of terrorist offences, as supposed in this case, presents the authorities with special problems, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain the second applicant for eleven days without judicial intervention."
5,0,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
5,0,The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.
5,0,"That being so the conviction of the applicants was based ""to a decisive extent"" on these anonymous statements."
5,0,"It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room."
5,0,"In the present case the
applicant did not object to the constitution of the court-martial and
in any event, according to the Government, it does not follow from the
fact that the members of the court-martial were all subordinate in rank
to the Convening Officer (having no direct prior relationship with that
Officer) that they lacked independence or impartiality.
"
5,0,"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine)."
5,0,"It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness."
5,0,"The principal purpose of the investigation and report of the Inspectors, they maintained, was to acquire, marshal and set down factual information which would enable the various competent authorities - such as the Director General of Fair Trading, the prosecuting authorities, the Bank of England, the Takeover Panel and the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 23, 27, 30 and 34 above) - to decide what action, if any, to take. "
5,0,The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above). 
5,0,"The applicants pointed out that the Inspectors’ report containing findings of dishonesty was published, with the benefit of protection from liability in defamation, even though the authorities decided that there was no cause for instituting either criminal or civil proceedings (see paragraphs 23, 27, 28 and 30 above)."
5,0,"In the present case, the Court acknowledges that the applicant had filed numerous requests, complaints and motions and had repeatedly failed to obey the authorities' summons."
5,0,"As has been noted in several previous judgments by the Court, the campaign of terrorism waged in Northern Ireland over the last quarter of a century has taken a terrible toll, especially in terms of human life and suffering (see paragraph 35 above)."
5,0,"It follows
that it cannot examine whether or not the first applicant was guilty
or innocent."
5,0,"The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts. However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings, and it is therefore impossible to reject the application on this ground."
5,0,"Admittedly, ""there was never any probing examination of her collecting money"" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above)."
5,0,"The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49)."
5,0,None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above).
5,0,"Whilst continuing to maintain that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued, they stressed that their complaint was not directed against the defence of privilege as such. They were not asserting a right to hold the Inspectors or the Secretary of State personally liable for damages in a suit for defamation; nor were they arguing that such independent reports into the affairs of public companies should never be prepared or published."
5,0,Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families.
5,0,"This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence."
5,0,"In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D.
54.  For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley."
5,0,"It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be."
5,0,"The Commission, after analysing the purposes served by the preparation and publication of the Inspectors’ report, came to the conclusion that the Inspectors had an ""investigative rather than determinative"" role (paragraph 64 of the Commission’s report)."
5,0,"In the latter connection, judicial review would have provided relief if it could have been established that the Inspectors had made findings of fact not properly based on material with probative value, or reached conclusions which there were no facts to support, or taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations, or reached conclusions which no reasonable person in their position could have reached (ibid.)."
5,0,"The threats to which the applicant claimed to have been exposed after he had complained to the Commission, as well as his tragic death in circumstances which have so far not been fully clarified, are further elements which may at least support the view that the pursuance of remedies may not be devoid of serious risks."
5,0,The Court therefore concludes that it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mehmet Şah died during a clash. 
5,0,"In particular, the denial of access to a lawyer, doctor, relative or friend and the absence of any realistic possibility of being brought before a court to test the legality of the detention meant that he was left completely at the mercy of those holding him."
5,0,"  The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay’s case."
5,0,"The applicant also refers to
the relationship of the members of the court-martial, the Convening
Officer and the Reviewing Authorities to the prosecuting authority."
5,0,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison."
5,0,"She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above)."
5,0,"Furthermore, members of a body could by reason of their joint decisions and actions be found guilty if they had thereby knowingly committed acts which amounted to an offence."
5,0,The Court has accepted above (paragraph 65) that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 and died on 23 November 1993 while he was under the control of the security authorities of the respondent state.
5,0,"The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, was of the opinion that the facts which had been invoked against him at the time of his arrest and during his continued detention (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 13 above) could not, in the eyes of an objective observer, be construed as misappropriation of funds or as a breach of official duties aimed at facilitating the commission of such an offence."
5,0,They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place.
5,0,The Court draws very strong inferences from the lack of any documentary evidence indicating that Mehmet Şah was taken into custody.
5,0,"It recalls that in the Brogan and Others case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to the time laid down by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism"
5,0," There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
5,0,"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 32 above)."
5,0,"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation."
5,0,The applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct.
5,0," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
5,0,"In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. "
5,0," As regards the applicant's complaints concerning conjugal rights, the Commission finds no indication that on the facts of the present case the applicant enjoyed any ""civil right"" with respect to the enjoyment of conjugal rights in the absence of the consent of his wife."
5,0,"The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73)."
5,0,"  On the other hand, the Court notes that there are substantial delays attributable to the authorities."
5,0,"Furthermore, it notes that the applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine of GRD 1,000 per day of detention, which sum he paid."
5,0, The question therefore arises whether the members of the court martial were sufficiently independent of the convening officer and whether the organisation of the trial offered adequate guarantees of impartiality.
5,0,The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence.
5,0,"since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place."
5,0,"The principal question addressed by the Inspectors in the instant case can be reduced to whether the Fayed brothers had dishonestly misled the authorities and the public in order to obtain Government clearance and acceptance by the HOF Board of their bid (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The Inspectors’ published findings - that the applicants had indeed made dishonest representations concerning their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources and had thereafter knowingly submitted false evidence to the Inspectors (see paragraph 22 above) - undoubtedly damaged the applicants’ reputations."
5,0,"The applicant submits that the 1988 Order, which permits
inferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer police
questions or to give evidence, and the reliance placed upon it by the
trial judge in the instant case,"
5,0,"The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a ""transparently honest witness"", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above)."
5,0,"The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs."
5,0,"Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information."
5,0,"Moreover, no evidence has been adduced to show that such decisions were unlawful, that is to say contrary to Bulgaria’s Constitution or legislation, or more specifically that the decisions were taken in excess of powers or were contrary to the law on the national budget."
5,0,"As to the length of the police custody of the second applicant, the Court observes that he was held in police custody for eleven days from 22 November to 3 December 1993."
5,0,"because the statutory framework according to which it proceeded was too vague and imprecise; for example, it was silent on the question of how the convening officer, confirming officer and reviewing authorities were to be appointed."
5,0," impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary
of State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had
a defence of absolute or qualified privilege."
5,0,"Thus, in the Commission’s decision on admissibility, he is reported as referring in particular to the facts that the members of the court martial were appointed ad hoc, that the judge advocate’s advice on sentencing was not disclosed, that no reasons were given for the decisions taken by the court-martial board and the confirming and reviewing officers, and that the post-hearing reviews were essentially administrative in nature and conducted in private (see the Commission’s decision on admissibility, application no. 22107/93, pp. 32 35)."
5,0,He alleges that witnesses on his behalf were not duly heard by the courts.
5,0,"The complaint concerning Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement
64.   In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. The Judge Advocate General, Judge Rant, had commented: ""These are extremely serious allegations ..."".
In a later letter, Judge Rant wrote:
""I wish to make it clear that, at this stage and without prejudice to any action which might have to be taken in the future, I am making no formal complaint about the passage [from the applicant’s submission to the Commission] quoted in that letter. The reason for this is that the case of Findlay is to be argued before the European Court of Human Rights in September 1996 and therefore it is only proper for me to defer action until the end of those proceedings."""
5,0,Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).
5,0," In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that
the question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or
military authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though
by agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain
matters to the civilian authorities."
5,0,The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy.
5,0,"It follows that he was not tried or punished again ""for an
offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted""."
5,0," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
5,0,"They contend that it is implicit from that finding that the
jury considered that there had been no plot to kill the deceased
terrorists, that the soldiers had honestly and reasonably believed that
there was a car bomb which could be detonated by remote control and
that the degree of force used by the soldiers was proportionate to the
aim of protecting the lives of the people of Gibraltar."
5,0," Furthermore, as explained below (see paragraph 79), the autopsy examination, which had critical importance in determining the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, was defective in fundamental aspects."
5,0,"The applicant, for his part, stressed that the decisions leading to the charges against him and his being detained on remand had been taken collectively by the government at the time and in a manner which was consistent with the relevant law, including the then Bulgarian Constitution; the allocation of the funds in question had been effected in accordance with the national budget as adopted by the National Assembly and had subsequently been approved by the latter."
5,0,"Those disputes, and in particular the applicants’ libel claims that Lonrho, through The Observer, had wrongfully damaged their reputations, were being adjudicated by the ordinary courts (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above)."
5,0," The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness."
5,0,It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.
5,0,"The Court accepts that there was in principle a need both for powers of the kind granted by section 14 of the 1978 Act and, in the particular case, to enter and search the home of the Murray family in order to arrest Mrs Murray."
5,0,"In this context the
applicants also allege a lack of genuine investigations by public
prosecutors and other competent authorities; the absence of any cases
showing the payment of adequate compensation to villagers for the
destruction of their homes and villages, or for their expulsion; an
official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces
and the lack of any prosecutions against members of the security forces
for the alleged offences connected with the destruction of villages and
forcible expulsions."
5,0,The Court cannot find that the Government has given sufficient explanation for these delays that occurred.
5,0,The Court also observes in this context that the autopsy report lacked valuable and important information which would clarify the circumstance surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah.
5,0,"It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above)."
5,0,"They rather resemble the incrimination of a person’s status, in this case the first applicant’s kinship relationship."
5,0,"They disputed that the impugned measures all formed an integral part of Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention or that the domestic courts had affirmed their lawfulness, in particular as concerns the retention of the records including the photograph of Mrs Murray."
5,0,"Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence."
5,0,"the lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities, who ignore the evidence of their own eyes, as in this case, and either do nothing or simply take evidence from the members of the police or security forces;"
5,0,"The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy (cf. the Inspectors' report paras. 16.2.5

and 16.6.2, pp. 5-6 above)."
5,0," In the examination of the matter of ""reasonable suspicion"", the key issue seems to me to be whether ""at least some facts or information"" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence."
5,0,"In the light of the reasons

upon which those findings are based, the Commission also considers that the facts of the present case fail to disclose an ""arguable claim"" of

a violation of these provisions."
5,0,The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen. 
5,0,This submission was contested by the Government and by a majority of the Commission.
5,0,"No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment)."
5,0,"The Inspectors’ report, published to the world at large, had the force of a judgment convicting the applicants of dishonesty."
5,0,"Finally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based ""to a decisive extent"" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses."
5,0,"The Government have contended, inter alia, that the report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants."
5,0,"Again, they referred to a number of decisions of the domestic courts, including a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a case concerning a claim for damages for torture, where it was held that offences committed by members of the security forces were governed by the Code of Obligations and that, under Article 53 of that Code, an acquittal for lack of evidence in criminal proceedings was not binding on the civil courts."
5,0,"The Court notes, firstly, that the applicant was convicted by the Greek courts of disturbing, through his writings, the public peace and the peace of the citizens of Western Thrace."
5,0,The applicant was not detained on remand prior to his trial and the judicial control of the lawfulness of his subsequent detention after conviction was provided by the first instance court
5,0,"The Government further maintained that, in order to be effective, the judicial power to sanction attempts by any person in the courtroom to dominate the court and determine the course of the trial had to be exercised immediately."
5,0,"once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means ""that she was suspected of having committed a given offence""."
5,0,"Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above)."
5,0,"Although it might be fair to say that no investigation into the applicants' affairs would have been started if Lonrho had not launched its campaign against them, the actual investigation by the Inspectors and their report indicate no malice or unreasonableness."
5,0,However these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability.
5,0,The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own.
5,0,The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above).
5,0,"Whilst Inspectors are accorded broad freedom in reporting on the affairs of public companies, the performance of their investigative functions is attended by not inconsiderable safeguards intended to ensure a fair procedure and the reliability of findings of fact."
5,0,They stated that the applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage.
5,0,"in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring before a court the case of his continueddetention or of his re-detention following the revocationof his licence;"
5,0,"They complain that the Inquest was inadequate, inter alia, as
public interest certificates were used to block crucial evidence."
5,0,"In the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant."
5,0," In this respect the applicant points mainly to the lack of
reasons for the decisions of the court-martial, the Confirming Officer
and the Reviewing Authorities, the privacy surrounding the advice given
by the Judge Advocate and the Judge Advocate General's office, together
with the administrative and private nature of the post-hearing reviews."
5,0,"The anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there."
5,0,"  In view of the above, the Court concludes that Mehmet Şah was deprived of his life in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent State."
5,0,"In the light of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the conduct for which the applicant was prosecuted constituted a criminal offence under Bulgarian law at the relevant time."
5,0,"However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public."
5,0,"As regards the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor
for 48 hours, the Government contend that this delay did not
disadvantage the applicant in the conduct of his defence and"
5,0,"firstly, that the suspects were armed;"
5,0," First, there were no grounds for believing that the applicant would not have been convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and dismissed from the army following his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), even if the court martial had been differently organised."
5,0,"Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim."
5,0,"However, the Court is satisfied that the functions performed by the Inspectors were, in practice as well as in theory, essentially investigative"
5,0,The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses.
5,0,"It does not appear that any attempt was made to carry out an on-site inspection at the scene of the incident, to establish the true version of the facts through questioning other villagers who might have witnessed the events or to interview the members of security forces who were allegedly involved in the incident."
5,0,"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 18 above). "
5,0,"Further, the denial
of access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours and the
discriminatory practice of not permitting solicitors to be present at
any stage while a person arrested under prevention of terrorism
provisions is being interviewed,"
5,0,The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts.
5,0,"The investigation of certain aspects of their private lives was necessary in view of their claims about their personal backgrounds, which they themselves had vaunted through the media, and as a result of which they had enjoyed a good business reputation for quite some time; hence their success in the HOF takeover bid."
5,0,"Safeguards afforded to the applicants throughout the investigation included constant consultation by the Inspectors as regards the structure, procedure and lines of inquiry of the investigation, the professional representation of the applicants, at interviews as well as in the submission of evidence and argument, and the Inspectors’ concern to respect the applicants’ personal privacy as much as possible (see paragraphs 15 to 18 and 20 above)."
5,0,not having applied for judicial review either of the Inspectors’ conduct of the inquiry or of their decision to submit their report to the Secretary of State;
5,0,"Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA."
5,0,"Neither honesty of an arresting officer, nor honesty of superior officer, nor the circumstances of a suspected terrorist crime fall into this category."
5,0,"From the recorded questions about her brothers or ""about money and about America"", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her ""that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA""."
5,0,"In this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened."
5,0,"As a whole the report may be said to be balanced and thorough; it is not a one-sided condemnation of the applicants and

gives them credit where credit is due for their business activities."
5,0," The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29)."
5,0,"They contend that soldiers are trained to shoot to kill
without warning and that the operation in Gibraltar was neither planned
nor executed in such a way as to minimise the need for the use of
lethal force."
5,0," The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation."
5,0,"In particular, it considers that the seriousness of the conviction and the prison sentence imposed on the applicant must have had a negative impact on his professional reputation and on his political image, particularly in a small country like Cyprus."
5,0,"Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation."
5,0,"The Government
point out, inter alia, that the members of the court-martial take an
oath of independence and impartiality,"
5,0,"""Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him."""
5,0,"This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49)."
5,0,"The first stage of the applicants’ argument, which was disputed by the Government and not accepted by the Commission, was that"
5,0,"However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been ""charged"" any longer."
5,0,"In the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of ""decisive extent"" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34)."
5,0,"He refers, inter alia, to the
status, roles and duties of the Convening Officer, the Judge Advocate
and the Judge Advocate General's office."
5,0,"The
Government further submit that the decision of the court-martial was
reasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army
life, the context in which the offences were committed and the
seriousness of the charges."
5,0,The prosecutor had believed that the funds concerned had been spent in a manner which was unlawful since there was no information as to whether they had appeared in the budget as an expenditure.
5,0,"since they involved the determination of Mr Findlay’s sentence following his plea of guilty to criminal charges; indeed, this point was not disputed before it"
5,0, Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above).
5,0,Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed
6,5,"Under the terms of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law""."
6,5,"The Commission is not satisfied in view of the
delays involved that this inquiry can be considered as furnishing an
effective remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention."
6,5,This part of the application can therefore also not be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
6,5,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate
to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can
provide effective and sufficient redress."
6,5,"The Commission has examined whether the applicant has complied
with the requirement imposed by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention
that an application must be introduced within six months of the final
decision taken in respect of the complaints."
6,5,"    In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's
complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not
constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of
exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26)
of the Convention."
6,5,"The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27
para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention."
6,5," The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected
for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para.
3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention."
6,5," It follows that this part of the case is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
"
6,5,"The Commission concludes that this application cannot be
rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and
27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention."
6,5," The Commission recalls that Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) of the
Convention imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to
interfere with the right of the individual effectively to present and
pursue his application before the Commission."
6,5,"The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union
constitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para.
1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and
procedures. "
6,5,"It follows that these
complaints must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies
under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
6,5,"The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention it may only deal with a complaint within a period of six
months from the date on which the final decision was taken."
6,5,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted. It follows that this complaint must also be rejected under
Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
6,5,as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention
6,5,"Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given."
6,5,"The Commission observes that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""should be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism"
6,5,The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.

6,5,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate

6,5,"According to Article 26 (Art. 26), the ""Commission may only deal

""The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken."""

the Convention it may only deal with a complaint after all domestic
remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised
rules under international law."
6,5,"To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
6,5,"The Commission concludes that the applicant may be said to have complied with the domestic remedies' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention and, consequently, the application cannot be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3).
"
6,5,"This part of the application cannot therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of
Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
6,5,"Under the terms of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law""."
6,5,"Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""the Commission may
only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been

law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final
decision was taken""."
6,5,"since
the applicants have failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by
Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention."
7,3," Concerning the first applicant, the Court recalls its finding under Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 103) that he was released before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible"
7,3,"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case."
7,3,"However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14)."
7,3,"The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above)."
7,3,"The Court discerns no reason, on the material before it, for not concluding that each of the various measures was ""in accordance with the law"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
7,3,The Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).
7,3,"In particular, a problem could arise under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the
Convention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him."
7,3,In claiming a right to use these terms the applicant was formulating a complaint which was linked to the alleged violation of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention.
7,3,It further notes that Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) is directly applicable;
7,3,The Commission finds that the publication of the Inspectors' report with certain of its findings constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.
7,3," Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out the circumstances when deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted."
7,3,It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.
7,3,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about."
7,3,"No further issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the
Convention.
"
7,3," In the light of the particular facts of the case, the Court finds that the various measures complained of can be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
7,3,"The Commission recalls that ""family life"" within the meaning of
Article 8 (Art. 8) may include at least the ties between near relatives
such as grandparents and grandchildren (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Marckx
judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, para. 45)."
7,3,"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5)."
7,3," The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no
other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in
Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention."
7,3,"The first applicant also alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, which provides:"
7,3,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy, cited above, § 95, Aydın, cited above, § 103, and Kaya, cited above, § 89)."
7,3,"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2)."
7,3,"However, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention."
7,3, The Court recalls that the primary concern of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is protection from an arbitrary deprivation of liberty.
7,3,"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
7,3," The applicants further submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) should be
interpreted as including a procedural element, namely, the provision
of an effective procedure after a lethal shooting for establishing the
facts."
7,3,"If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do"
7,3,"Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:

      ""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No
      one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases
      and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:

      (a)  the lawful detention of a person convicted by a competent
      court;

      (b)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-
      compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure
      the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;..."""
7,3,"The Commission finds that the applicant was deprived of his liberty ""after conviction by a competent court"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (Art. 5-1-a) of the Convention."
7,3,"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities."
7,3,The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).
7,3,No separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13).
7,3,"In these circumstances, and having regard to its conclusion under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it appropriate to draw inferences proposed by the applicants as to whether torture or ill-treatment occurred (see, in this respect, Tanlı, cited above, § 159)."
7,3,"Relying on the Commission's case-law on the question, they submitted that the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) was so closely and directly bound up with the deceased applicant's person that his heirs could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable them to continue the proceedings in his stead."
7,3,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant."
7,3,"The Commission also finds no evidence in the case to suggest an infringement of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (Art. 5-3, 5-4):"
7,3,"In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2
of Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the
requirement that the interference be ""in accordance with the law""
relates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia,
that the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must
moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him."
7,3," In respect of the first applicant, the Court reiterates that this provision guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention"
7,3,"   The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency."
7,3,"The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to
Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention."
7,3,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 (art. 13) must be ""effective"" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State."
7,3,The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.
7,3,"As to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, the Government submit that Turkish law guarantees several remedies (as described above at pp. 5-6) without discrimination."
7,3,"As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
7,3,under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.
7,3,The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.
7,3,"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to

the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
7,3,"Having regard to the conclusion it reached with regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 106), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily”"
7,3,"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53)."
7,3,"Her Majesty's Pleasure does not satisfy the
requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) since the Parole Board,
save immediately after recall, is unable to order release, the ultimate
decision resting with the executive. An applicant also has no right to
an oral hearing before the Board or to call his own witnesses or to
question the witnesses against him.

      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the
parties concerning the complaints raised by the applicant."
7,3,"The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (Oğur, cited above, § 88)."
7,3," Having regard to all these considerations, and while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1). "
7,3,"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention."
7,3,"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention."
7,3,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention."
7,3,"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2)."
7,3,Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority
7,3,"No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58)."
7,3,"Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) provides as follows:

      ""Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in
      contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an
      enforceable right to compensation."""
7,3,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted."
7,3," Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows:

""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this
Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy
before a national authority notwithstanding that the
violation has been committed by persons acting in an
official capacity."""
7,3,"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be."
7,3,These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes
7,3,"In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. "
7,3,"Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50). "
7,3," As the Court has held many times, Article 13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. "
7,3,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above)."
7,3,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 24 above). "
7,3,Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.
7,3,"Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law "
7,3," In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention."
7,3,"The Court notes that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law (Article 28 para. 1 of the Constitution - see paragraph 19 above)."
7,3,The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).
7,3,The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).
7,3,No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.
7,3,"The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law."
7,3," The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant. "
7,3," The Government submitted that Mr Ahmet Sadik had not exhausted domestic remedies, not having raised before the national courts, even in substance, the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). "
7,3,"They continuously reviewed the
detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's
health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.
"
7,3, It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).
7,3,"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41)."
7,3,"The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:
""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...
...
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ..."""
7,3," The Commission, examining this complaint in the light of the
above-cited Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, cannot find any
evidence that the first applicant has requested access to the notes
concerned."
7,3,The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established.
7,3,"At no time, however, did the applicant rely on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), or on arguments to the same or like effect based on domestic law, in the courts dealing with his case. "
7,3,"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future."
7,3,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention."
7,3,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about."
7,3,"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
7,3,"Applying the above general considerations to the case of Ahmet Sadik I note in the first place that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law  and that, moreover, Article 10 (art. 10) is directly applicable under Greek law."
7,3,"The Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was ""lawful"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected ""in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law""."
7,3,"Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
7,3,"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention""."
7,3,"They
submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) requires, in addition, that States
exercise strict operational control over the use of lethal force,
including the giving of appropriate training, briefings and
instructions."
7,3,"Consequently, my starting-point is that the Greek Supreme Court, when dealing with the applicant's appeal against his conviction by the Patras Court of Appeal, in principle could and should have applied Article 10 (art. 10) - as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights - ex officio (see paragraph 11 above). "
7,3,"In domestic law, sado-masochistic activities could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence without that being contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights."
7,3,"It involves rights under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention which is absolute, unqualified and non-derogable."
7,3,"They consider
that Article 2 (Art. 2) imposes a duty on States to adopt clear and
detailed legal rules on the use of lethal force, which strictly control
and limit that use."
7,3,"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)""."
7,3,"Whether or not a right to reputation is enshrined in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is immaterial, since such a right does exist, at least in principle, under all our national laws and it has not been contended that in this respect English law makes an exception by clearly and fully excluding such a right."
7,3," Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied."
7,3,"For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 78-80), no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which may be broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Articles 2 and 3 (Kaya, cited above, pp. 330-331, § 107, Salman, cited above, § 123, and Nuray Şen v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, § 193, 30 March 2004)."
7,3,The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.
7,3,Mr Ahmet Sadik could therefore have relied on that provision (art. 10) in the Greek courts and complained of a violation thereof in his case. 
7,3,"The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty."
7,3," As regards the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention and the derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15), the applicant contested the necessity of a measure permitting detention for as long as 30 days without any of the basic safeguards against abuse, which were deemed to be essential by the Convention organs"
7,3,The nature of the rights safeguarded under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13.
7,3,"an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies; and

-     whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies were ineffective in this case, owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress.
"
7,3,Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.
7,3,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the third and the fourth applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1
(Art. 8-1) can reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic
society"" within the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2)of that provision in
the interests of the second applicant."
7,3,The Commission recalls that under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention the right to compensation is conditional on a breach of one of the paragraphs of Article 5 (Art. 5).
7,3,"Before the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above)."
7,3,"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty."
7,3,The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).

9,8,"The Commission recalls that in the case of
Temple v. the United Kingdom (No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171) the Commission held that recourse to a purely discretionary power on the part of the Secretary of State did not constitute an effective domestic remedy."
9,8,The general rule that a husband could not commit the offence of rape against his wife was universally accepted until 1990.
9,8,"The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully
carried into effect until the end of August and in early September
1992."
9,8,"The present application, however, was lodged on 16 November 1992,
that is more than six months later."
9,8,"His
further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal was decided upon
in September 1993, also after an oral hearing."
9,8,"The applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the
Convention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on
13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons
being present."
9,8," In
the Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently
established any interferences with his right to freedom of expression
after 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of
the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.
"
9,8,"It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted."
9,8,"On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention
entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was
transferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National
Investigation Service."
9,8,"On this point, the Commission refers to its constant case-law (see, for example, No. 12164/86, Dec. 12.10.88, Agneessens v. Belgium, D.R. 58 p. 63)."
9,8,"He claims that he was at no time afforded a proper determination of his civil rights and obligations with particular reference to the conjugal rights of both parties to a marriage and, moreover, that he was denied a fair trial of the charge against him by reason of the failure of the courts to observe, and give proper effect to, the statutory definition of rape (as `unlawful sexual intercourse') in section 1 (1) of the Sexual
Offences (Amendment) Act 1976."""
9,8," The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from
7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the
Commission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention
to receive individual petitions."
9,8,"The Commission recalls that the placement order was based on the
1990 Act and was, accordingly, made in accordance with the law."
9,8,"The applicant's appeal to the County Administrative
Court was decided upon in May 1993 following an oral hearing."
9,8,"The applicant's request was examined by the Social Council in
December 1992."
9,8,"The present application
was lodged on 3 May 1993, i.e. within the six month period. "
9,8,"Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred.  In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary."
9,8,"After the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed
a request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor
General dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no
new circumstances justifying modification of detention."
9,8,"The application,
however, was lodged with the Commission on 16 November 1992."
9,8,"Reference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's
passport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992
prohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the
Public Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant
from seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention
up to 7 September 1992."
9,8,"The decision on appeal was delivered on 2 April 2001, long after the sentence had been served."
9,8,"In these
circumstances, the question arises whether the complaints insofar as
they relate to specific acts carried out on 13 November 1993 have been
introduced out of time, given that the application was introduced on
30 June 1993."
9,8,"In addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse. "
9,8,"The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort
dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992."
9,8,"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994."
9,8,"   In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the
final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e.
before 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the
Convention in respect of Bulgaria."
9,8,The Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given.
9,8," The Commission notes that S. 91 of the Austrian Court
Organisation Act, which entitles the parties to court proceedings to
lodge a request with the superior court to fix a time limit in respect
of a delayed procedural step, entered into force on 1 January 1990 when
the proceedings in question were already pending for one year."
9,8,"In particular, in the first set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of more than two years (from 3 January 1990 to 10 February 1992) while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further one of six years (from 13 May 1992 to 20 May 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal."
9,8," It is
submitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission
on 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date
on which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the
applicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been
exhausted."
9,8," On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to
the period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared
inadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions
of the Convention."
9,8,"At that
stage, the District Court had already been dealing with the applicant's
request of December 1988 and, in its decision of 10 August 1989,
postponed the examination thereof, and the Regional Court had decided
on the applicant's appeal on 29 November 1989."
9,8,"The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law.
When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed.  On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon.  In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created."
9,8,"Leaving aside the question of Sweden's reservation to this
provision, as valid at the relevant time, the Commission observes that
the situation complained of ceased to exist in 1991 when the second
applicant started attending elementary school."
9,8,"The Commission
recalls that where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a remedy
that remedy must be tried (e.g., No. 10148/82, Dec. 14.3.85, D.R. 42
p. 98)."
9,8,"The Commission considers that this complaint could be raised in
civil proceedings instituted by the first applicant for the purpose of
claiming the restoration of the money withdrawn (cf. No. 14451/88, Dec.
2.7.93, not published)."
9,8,"Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the
applicant submitted his application form to the Commission.
"
9,8," While in detention the applicant wrote
altogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared
after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
9,8,"Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife,"
9,8,"The Commission observes that the refusal at issue dates back to
28 January 1991."
9,8,"The fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990."
9,8,"There was case-law indicating that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife where a court had issued a decree nisi of divorce or a non-molestation order; where the husband had given an undertaking in lieu of an injunction not to molest his wife; where there was an agreement express or implied between the parties which made it clear that the implied consent of the wife was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.
"
9,8,"In the present case, the Commission observes that whereas in his
original application the applicant stated that his house was burnt down
on 3 January 1994, it appears that the incident under investigation by
the public prosecutor of Kulp district and the Kulp District
Administrative Board occurred on 13 November 1993."
9,8,"I consider that ""where there is doubt"", and especially where there is doubt, domestic remedies must be exhausted as required by the Commission (decision of 14 March 1985, Garcia v. Switzerland, application no. 10148/82, Decisions and Reports 42, p. 98). And the applicant did nothing of the sort."
9,8,"The
Commission is further aware that this provision has been considered by
Swedish courts as constituting the legal basis for access restrictions
concerning, for instance, grandparents (see No. 21608/93, Dec. 22.2.95,
not published)."
9,8,"The Commission finds that it is thus not faced with the issue of
an alleged absence of any reaction of the competent court to a
procedural request (cf. No. 19369/92, Dec. 8.1.93, not published)."
9,8,"The Commission observes that according to the travaux
préparatoires to the 1990 Act a decision not to transfer a child from
a ""family home"" is appealable in administrative court proceedings."
9,8,There was no authority for the proposition that a wife could unilaterally withdraw her consent.
9,8,"However, that interference was in accordance with the law, the publication being authorised by section 437 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 1985. "
9,8,"They submit that the applicant
failed to complain about the length in the course of the domestic court
proceedings and did not lodge a request under S. 91 of the Court
Organisation Act 1990 (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) that, in view of the
alleged delay, the superior court should fix an appropriate time-limit
for the conduct of the court proceedings."
9,8,The facts of this case do not disclose any mutual agreement between the applicant and his wife.
9,8,"Leave to appeal was
refused by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.
"
9,8,The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape.
9,8,"The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see eg. No. 458/59, X v. Belgium, Dec.
29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp.222, 236; No. 5258/71, X v. Sweden, Dec. 8.2.73,

9,8,It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact.

filed his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992."
9,8," was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.

      The Government contend that in the present case the facts indicated that the applicant's wife had revoked her consent by mutual agreement with the applicant."
9,8,"It is already the case in criminal law that the ""rape"" of a spouse where there is doubt whether consent was given may lead to prosecution."
9,8,"The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this
prohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992."
9,8,On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin. 
9,8,"As regards the first set of proceedings, the period to be taken into consideration began on 3 January 1990 and ended on 22 May 1999."
9,8,"The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date
on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria,
medical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and
28 August 1992."
9,8,"With regard to the first of these options, they submitted that he could have complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the public prosecutor who saw him on 10 December 1992 (see paragraph 18 above)."
9,8,"However, the application was lodged with the Commission on 11 July 1991, five months after the cassation decision,"
9,8,"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994."
9,8,"In the second set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of some three years (from 4 September 1990 to 10 August 1993), while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further such period of three years and seven months (from 5 January 1995 to 5 August 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal."
9,8,"On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further
appeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a
complaint with the Prosecutor General."
9,8,"However, the fact complained of relates to a period
prior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
9,8,"The
applicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order
of 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article
published on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written
materials to his lawyers."
9,8," It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"".  The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"".  The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape."
9,8,"In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect.
On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above)."
9,8,"The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating
to a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force
of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione
temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of
Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
