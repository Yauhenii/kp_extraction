606,607,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).,607,16.txt,The sentence of life imprisonment is not the same as the sentence of detention.

609,610," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",610,16.txt,The Court of Appeal's decision in the case of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP) v Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is likely to have implications for the law of detention in England and Wales.

615,616,"The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment.",616,16.txt,"In this case, the Court of Appeal considers whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment."

625,626, It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.,626,16.txt,The Court of Appeal has held that an application for judicial review must be made in writing to the Secretary of State for Justice.

927,928," The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness.",928,26.txt,"In a landmark case, the Court of Appeal has ruled that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence."
928,929,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,929,26.txt,The sentence of life imprisonment is not the same as the sentence of detention.
929,930,"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above).",930,26.txt,The early release of a prisoner who has been convicted of a serious crime and who has served half of his sentence must be done in the interests of public safety.
930,931,"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults.",931,26.txt,The Court of Appeal has rejected an appeal by the Ministry of Justice against a decision by the High Court to quash a detention sentence imposed on a young offender on the grounds that it was disproportionate.
931,932," It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion.",932,26.txt,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, summing up the Government’s position on the issue of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure."

933,934,"On the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word ""life"" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence.",934,26.txt,"On the one hand, it is undisputed that the use of the word ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" in the sentence ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" was not an abuse of power."
934,935," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",935,26.txt,The Court of Appeal's decision in the case of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP) v Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is likely to have implications for the law of detention in England and Wales.

",937,26.txt,The Court of Appeal has upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of a 15-year-old boy who was sent to a young offenders' institution after pleading guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm.
937,938,"However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.",938,26.txt,It is not unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to be detained indefinitely.
938,939,"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older.",939,26.txt,The sentencing of young offenders in England and Wales is influenced by a number of considerations.
939,940,"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",940,26.txt,The European Court of Human Rights has held that section 53 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) does not apply to children under the age of 18.

942,943,"Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government.",943,26.txt,"In the House of Commons today, the Secretary of State for Justice said that the Parole Board had the power to decide whether a prisoner should be released."
943,944,"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",944,26.txt,The Parole Board is a quasi-judicial body which is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts.

946,947," The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.",947,26.txt,The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has upheld the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to uphold the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to uphold the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU
