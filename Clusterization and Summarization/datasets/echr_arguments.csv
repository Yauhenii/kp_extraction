1,The Commission notes that the applicant was detained after having been sentenced by the first instance court to 18 months' imprisonment.
2,"He was released after the Court of Appeal reviewed this sentence, reducing it to 15 months' imprisonment, convertible to a fine."
3," Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person, subject to certain exceptions, such as the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court, within the meaning of sub-paragraph (a) of the provision."
4,"The Commission finds that the applicant was deprived of his liberty ""after conviction by a competent court"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (Art. 5-1-a) of the Convention."
5,"The Commission also finds no evidence in the case to suggest an infringement of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (Art. 5-3, 5-4):"
6,The applicant was not detained on remand prior to his trial and the judicial control of the lawfulness of his subsequent detention after conviction was provided by the first instance court
7,"The applicant was not detained on remand prior to his trial and the judicial control of the lawfulness of his subsequent detention after conviction was provided by the first instance court (cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 40, para. 76)."
8,"However, again, the Commission finds no evidence in the case to substantiate this complaint."
9,The applicant next complains under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention of
10,"in that , allegedly, insufficient reasons were given by the courts to justify his conviction.
"
11,The applicant further complains of the attitude of some of the judges
12,and of not having received a written copy of the first instance judgment in time for the preparation of his appeal.
13,"He alleges that witnesses on his behalf were not duly heard by the courts."
14,"Under the terms of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law""."
15,"  For this condition to be fulfilled, it is not sufficient for the applicant merely to have presented his case to the various courts competent to deal with it."
16,"The complaint made before the Commission must also have been raised, at least in substance, during the proceedings in question."
17,"Under the terms of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law""."
18," In the present case, the Commission notes that none of these complaints has been raised either formally or even in substance during the proceedings before the Court of Cassation."
19,"In addition, the examination of the case has disclosed no circumstance which, according to the generally recognised principles of international law, might have absolved the applicant from raising these complaints during the cassation proceedings."
20,"On this point, the Commission refers to its constant case-law (see, for example, No. 12164/86, Dec. 12.10.88, Agneessens v. Belgium, D.R. 58 p. 63)."

28,Everyone has the right to the freedom of expression.
29,"This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authorities and regardless of frontiers ..."
30,"  The exercice of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime ...""."
31,"on 27 September 1991, which is more than six months after the date on which the final decision regarding the applicant's case was given by the Court of Cassation on 15 February 1991.
"
32,"However, the application was lodged with the Commission on 11 July 1991, five months after the cassation decision,"
33,"The Commission observes that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""should be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism"
34,"However, while basing his case on the narrower domestic criminal law provision of Article 192 of the Greek Penal Code, the applicant claimed the right to use the words ""Turk(s)"" or ""Turkish"" to identify the Moslems of Western Thrace."
35, The Commission considers that this indicates an issue falling within the scope of freedom of expression.
36,In claiming a right to use these terms the applicant was formulating a complaint which was linked to the alleged violation of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention.
37,  Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-3) provides for free elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.
38,"because of his detention."
39, The Commission considers that this indicates an issue falling within the scope of freedom of expression.
40,"The Commission concludes that the applicant has complied with the requirements of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention."
41,"These complaints cannot therefore be regarded as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring this part of the case inadmissible has been established."
42,The Commission notes that the applicant's conviction involved his writings.
43,"The applicant does not dispute the existence of a legal basis for his conviction, but he maintains that the conviction and punishment inflicted upon him were without any legitimate purpose"
44,under the Convention and alleges that they constituted a kind of reprisal for his assertion of his Turkish ethnic origin.
45,He also maintains that his conviction and the penal sanctions inflicted upon him were not necessary in a democratic society.
46,He stresses the key role played by freedom of expression in a democratic society. 
47,"because at no time at first instance, on appeal or in cassation did the applicant raise the issues under the Convention, even in substance."
48,"The Government next submits, in respect of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention"
49," In reply the applicant maintains that the breach of which he is complaining consists of a continuing violation,"
50,"it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs should have been raised at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"" (Eur. Court H.R., Castells judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, para. 27)."
51,"Therefore, ""he provided the national courts with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (Art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them"" (Eur. Court H.R., Guzzardi judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72)."
52,"that it would not be justified to strike it off the list of cases."
53,"The Commission concludes that the applicant may be said to have complied with the domestic remedies' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention and, consequently, the application cannot be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3).
"
54,"The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts. However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings, and it is therefore impossible to reject the application on this ground."
55,"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole. "
56,The Commission notes the declaration by the applicant's representatives that the applicant's father wishes to pursue proceedings before the Commission.
57,"Moreover, it finds that, in view of the serious nature of the complaints and their connection with the general situation in South-East Turkey,"
58,the application is of such general interest 
59, it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.
60,"Moreover, when asked to sign a statement, he had answered that he could not sign because he could not move his hands."
61, The Commission notes the applicant's declaration that he had told the public prosecutor that he had been tortured. 
62,"It is not possible to establish in detail what happened during the applicant's meeting with the public prosecutor, but the Commission finds no reason to doubt that during their conversation there were elements which should have made the public prosecutor initiate an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information from the applicant about his state of health or about the treatment to which he had been subjected."
63,"Moreover, his family had also been affected by the actions of the authorities insofar as his father and one of his brothers had been detained for short periods at about the same time, and the applicant himself was hospitalised for two weeks after his release."
64,"The threats to which the applicant claimed to have been exposed after he had complained to the Commission, as well as his tragic death in circumstances which have so far not been fully clarified, are further elements which may at least support the view that the pursuance of remedies may not be devoid of serious risks."
65,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicant, because"
66," The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective."
67,"He did not deny that the procedures identified by the Government are formally part of the Turkish legal structure, but he contended that the Government have not shown how such procedures could conceivably be effective for the specific circumstances of the present case."
68,The applicant considered that none of the remedies suggested by the Government could be regarded as effective because the scale of torture committed with impunity by agents of the State in detention centres is such that this must be considered high-level Government policy - an administrative practice - in regard to which all remedies are theoretical and irrelevant.
69,"This has been confirmed by such bodies as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which, in its public statement of 15 December 1992, concluded that the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in Turkey, and that such methods are applied to both ordinary criminal suspects and persons held under anti-terrorist provisions (p. 6 para. 21)."
70," The purported remedies were thus ineffective for the following reasons:"
71,"the limitations on rights and remedies created by the state of emergency;"
72," an administrative practice of torture in Turkish detention centres;"
73,"the lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities, who ignore the evidence of their own eyes, as in this case, and either do nothing or simply take evidence from the members of the police or security forces;"
74," even if an investigation is made, the lack of effective action being taken afterwards;"
75,"an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces;"
76," the positive discouragement of those who do wish to seek remedies, as has been demonstrated so tragically in the present case;"
77,"an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies; and

-     whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies were ineffective in this case, owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress.
"
78,"At present 16 lawyers are facing criminal charges, which include drawing up documents belittling the Turkish State and faxing them to human rights organisations in Europe. "
79,"This is demonstrated in other cases pending before the Commission."
80,Another key group in guaranteeing effective investigation and protection is the medical profession.
81,"Doctors must be free to give
honest accounts of what they have found in their investigations."
82,"However, the applicant alleged that doctors have been intimidated, as
was the case of the doctor whom he consulted at the Dicle Medical Faculty."
83,the Government have referred to a number of judgments by the administrative and criminal courts.
84,"Some of these decisions concern cases in which the State Council has ordered the prosecution of public officials for ill-treating people in custody, despite the initial view of the local administrative council that the cases were unsuitable for criminal proceedings."
85,"the second requirement of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, namely that of lodging the application within six months of the final effective decision or, if none, within six months of the events of which complaints are made.

"
86,"The present application
was lodged on 3 May 1993, i.e. within the six month period. "
87,"The Government submit that it is generally accepted in the comparative and international law on terrorism, authorising ""certain adaptations of the liberal model"", that restrictions on Convention rights will be deemed necessary in a democratic society threatened by terrorist violence, as being proportionate to the aim of protecting public order."
88," The threat posed to Turkey by the PKK and its affiliations is internationally recognised, as is the need to react firmly to it. "
89,"In this respect the Government assert that the powers exercised by the police while the applicant was in their custody did not exceed the margin of appreciation conferred on States by the Convention."
90,"They add that his death was not the work of any State agent but that of terrorist in-fighting."
91,"As to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, the Government submit that Turkish law guarantees several remedies (as described above at pp. 5-6) without discrimination."
92,The application principally concerns torture and inhuman conditions of detention.
93,"It involves rights under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention which is absolute, unqualified and non-derogable."
94," As regards the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention and the derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15), the applicant contested the necessity of a measure permitting detention for as long as 30 days without any of the basic safeguards against abuse, which were deemed to be essential by the Convention organs"
95,"(Eur. Court H.R., Brannigan and McBride judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258- B, pp. 55-56, paras. 62-66)."
96,The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts.
97,"However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings,"
98,"It is furthermore established that the burden of
proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies
lies upon the State invoking the rule"
99,"(cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Jong,
Baljet and Van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p.
18, para. 36, and Nos. 14116/88 and 14117/88, Sargin and Yagci v.
Turkey, Dec. 11.05.89, D.R. 61 p. 250, 262)."
100,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions."
101,"The Commission concludes that this application cannot be
rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and
27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention."
102,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate
to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can
provide effective and sufficient redress."
103,"The Commission is not satisfied in view of the
delays involved that this inquiry can be considered as furnishing an
effective remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention."
104,"The Commission has examined whether the applicant has complied
with the requirement imposed by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention
that an application must be introduced within six months of the final
decision taken in respect of the complaints."
105,"In the present case, the Commission observes that whereas in his
original application the applicant stated that his house was burnt down
on 3 January 1994, it appears that the incident under investigation by
the public prosecutor of Kulp district and the Kulp District
Administrative Board occurred on 13 November 1993."
106,"The Commission
found above that the applicant is not required to pursue domestic
remedies in light of their apparent ineffectiveness."
107,"However,
special considerations could apply in exceptional cases where an
applicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later
stage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances
which make that remedy ineffective."
108,"becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances
which make that remedy ineffective."
109,"The case-law of the Commission establishes that where no domestic
remedy is available, the six months period runs from the act complained
of"
110,"(see eg.  No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171)."
111,"the alleged
events seem to have occurred in November 1993 and the investigation has
not yet been concluded. The Commission is not satisfied in view of the
delays involved that this inquiry can be considered as furnishing an
effective remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention."
112,"Given that these circumstances do not disclose any indication
of a delay on the part of the applicant in introducing his application
once it must have become apparent that no redress for his complaints
was forthcoming, the Commission considers that the relevant date for
the purposes of the six months time limit should not be considered to
be a date earlier than February 1994."
113,"In such a situation, the six months
period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes
aware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances"
114,"In these
circumstances, the question arises whether the complaints insofar as
they relate to specific acts carried out on 13 November 1993 have been
introduced out of time, given that the application was introduced on
30 June 1993."
115,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether
there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish
authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by
the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not
been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies
under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints."
116,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the
destruction of homes and property in villages and towns."
117,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate
to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can
provide effective and sufficient redress."
118,"An applicant does not need
to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach."
119,"(cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Jong,
Baljet and Van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p.
18, para. 36, and Nos. 14116/88 and 14117/88, Sargin and Yagci v.
Turkey, Dec. 11.05.89, D.R. 61 p. 250, 262)."
120,"It is furthermore established that the burden of
proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies
lies upon the State invoking the rule "
121,"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether
there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish
authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by
the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not
been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies
under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints."
122,"In the present case, the Government have not provided any
additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from
the above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the
destruction of homes and property in villages and towns."
123,"In respect of damage alleged to have been caused by the State or
its agents, the Government submit that the applicants had the
possibility of introducing an action for compensation before the civil
or administrative courts relying, inter alia, on Article 125 of the
Turkish Constitution or Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990."
124,"The Government also submit that alleged arson, destruction of
property and threatening conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code,
in respect of which complaints could be lodged with the competent
authorities, civil or military.
"
125,"since
the applicants have failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by
Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention."
126,"Any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate
and ineffective since, inter alia, the operation in question in this
case was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the
State and having regard, inter alia, to the situation in South-East
Turkey which is such that potential applicants have a well-founded fear
of the consequences if they should pursue remedies."
127,"In this context the
applicants also allege a lack of genuine investigations by public
prosecutors and other competent authorities; the absence of any cases
showing the payment of adequate compensation to villagers for the
destruction of their homes and villages, or for their expulsion; an
official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces
and the lack of any prosecutions against members of the security forces
for the alleged offences connected with the destruction of villages and
forcible expulsions."
128," The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected
for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para.
3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention."
129,"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties'
submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under
the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an
examination of the merits of the application as a whole. The Commission
concludes, therefore, that the application is not manifestly ill-
founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the
Convention."
130,"Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) provides as follows:

      ""Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in
      contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an
      enforceable right to compensation."""
131,The applicant submits that the effect of Section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1991 is to deprive him of the remedy to which he had previously been entitled.
132,"The applicant submits that, although domestic law categorises the proceedings at issue in the present case as civil, both the nature of the proceedings and the actual penalty imposed indicate that a criminal charge was in fact determined."
133,"This part of the application cannot therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of
Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
134,This part of the application can therefore also not be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
135,"After a preliminary examination of the complaints under Article 5 para. 1 (a) and (b) (Art. 5-1-a, 5-1-b) of the Convention, the Commission finds that they raise complex issues of fact and law which must be examined on the merits."
136,The Commission recalls that under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention the right to compensation is conditional on a breach of one of the paragraphs of Article 5 (Art. 5).
137," He considers that, whatever the nature of the proceedings, they were so complex as to require proper legal representation, especially regarding the alternatives to immediate imprisonment."
138,"He alleges a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.

      Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:

      ""1.  In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or
      of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a
      fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an
      independent and impartial tribunal established by law...

      3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following
      minimum rights:

      (c)   to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of
      his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for
      legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of
      justice so require."""
139,The Commission finds that this complaint also raises complex issues of fact and law which must be examined on the merits. This part of the application cannot therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention either.
140,"He submits that the present case cannot be distinguished from the R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court ex parte Davies case,"
141,"The applicant notes that in its judgment in the present case the Divisional Court answered the Magistrates' questions, ""Whether before issuing the ... warrant, (they) conducted an adequate inquiry into the appellant's means"", and ""Whether the following finding of fact can be supported by the evidence before the Magistrates' Court, namely that the applicant's failure to pay which led to the liability order being made was due to his culpable neglect"", in the negative."
142,"Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:

      ""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No
      one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases
      and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:

      (a)  the lawful detention of a person convicted by a competent
      court;

      (b)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-
      compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure
      the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;..."""
143,"They rely on the absence of any suggestion in the High Court's judgment that the applicant's detention was unlawful."
144,The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.
145,The Commission notes that in the context of the section 9 powers the Secretary of State has a very wide discretion.
146,It appears that he has only exercised his discretion under section 9 in five cases and that there is no example of any enforcement of those directions being pursued in the courts. 
147,"The Commission recalls that in the case of
Temple v. the United Kingdom (No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171) the Commission held that recourse to a purely discretionary power on the part of the Secretary of State did not constitute an effective domestic remedy."
148,"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. "
149,as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention
150,"since she has not applied to the Secretary of State to exercise his power under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to direct a local authority to comply with its statutory duty to provide such sites and if necessary, to enforce such directions in the courts."
151,"The Secretary of State's power under section 9 is, she contends, discretionary and rarely exercised."
152,"To the extent that there might have been any interference with her rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1), the Government consider that the refusal of planning permission and issue of the enforcement notices are justified by the interests of public safety on the road, the economic well-being of the country and the protection of the environment."
153,"As for the framework of regulation, including the designation system, this is stated to represent a proportionate response to the need to protect public safety on the roads as well as the rights of others."
154,under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.
155," As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go."
156,"She submits that there is an acknowledged shortfall of sites for gypsies in South Cambridgeshire and that local authorities are failing to fulfil their statutory duty to provide sites."
157,"The applicant also contends that it is a practical impossibility for her to station her caravans on her sister's site and that even if there were vacant pitches on the nearby official site, it is overcrowded and has a reputation for violence which renders it an unsafe location for a single woman living alone with her children."
158,"Further, the designation system which discriminates against gypsies prevents her moving onto unoccupied land or stationing her caravans near the highway."
159,"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies."
160,It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.
161,"(cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec. 11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102)."
162,"It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec. 11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102)."
163,The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.
164,"An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (cf. No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78)."
165, since as a matter of fact she was and is able to live either on the neighbouring land lawfully occupied by her sister or to apply for a place on one of the many other local authority and private gipsy caravan sites throughout Cambridgeshire.
166,She also has not been subject to any of the criminal sanctions which may applied under the designation system.
167,"Further, they point out that applicant took up residence on her land without prior planning permission."
168,"She invokes Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which provides:

      ""1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and
      family life, his home and his correspondence.

      2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with
      the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with
      the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests
      of national security, public safety or the economic well-being
      of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
      protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the
      rights and freedoms of others."""
169,"The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the parties. It considers that the applicant's complaint raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. "
170," As regards the applicant's complaints concerning conjugal rights, the Commission finds no indication that on the facts of the present case the applicant enjoyed any ""civil right"" with respect to the enjoyment of conjugal rights in the absence of the consent of his wife."
171,"As regards the applicant's complaints concerning the decisions of the courts in the criminal proceedings, the Commission recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 (Art. 19) of the Convention, its only task is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the
Parties in the Convention."
172,"In particular, it is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention."
173,"The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see eg. No. 458/59, X v. Belgium, Dec.
29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp.222, 236; No. 5258/71, X v. Sweden, Dec. 8.2.73,
Collection 43 pp.71, 77; No. 7987/77, X v. Austria, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R.
18 pp. 31, 45)."
174,He relies on Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.
175,"He claims that he was at no time afforded a proper determination of his civil rights and obligations with particular reference to the conjugal rights of both parties to a marriage and, moreover, that he was denied a fair trial of the charge against him by reason of the failure of the courts to observe, and give proper effect to, the statutory definition of rape (as `unlawful sexual intercourse') in section 1 (1) of the Sexual
Offences (Amendment) Act 1976."""
176,The general rule that a husband could not commit the offence of rape against his wife was universally accepted until 1990.
177,"While exceptions to this principle had developed, these were strictly limited to circumstances where, for example, there had been a court order or formal separation agreement."
178,The facts of this case do not disclose any mutual agreement between the applicant and his wife.
179,"There was no authority for the proposition that a wife could unilaterally withdraw her consent."
180,"Furthermore, in the applicant's case, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords acknowledged that they were changing the law, not merely clarifying it."
181,"There was case-law indicating that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife where a court had issued a decree nisi of divorce or a non-molestation order; where the husband had given an undertaking in lieu of an injunction not to molest his wife; where there was an agreement express or implied between the parties which made it clear that the implied consent of the wife was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.
"
182," was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.

      The Government contend that in the present case the facts indicated that the applicant's wife had revoked her consent by mutual agreement with the applicant."
183,"Even if the decisions of the courts were based rather on the fact that a wife was able unilaterally to withdraw her consent, this was a reasonable interpretation of the existing law in the light of changing social circumstances and clarified the existing elements of the offence."
184," As regards the applicant's complaints concerning conjugal rights, the Commission finds no indication that on the facts of the present case the applicant enjoyed any ""civil right"" with respect to the enjoyment of conjugal rights in the absence of the consent of his wife."
185," It follows that this part of the case is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
"
186,It follows that this part of the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
187," The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44)."
188,"However, while Mr Findlay in his application to the Commission may not expressly have invoked his rights under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) to a ""public hearing"" and a ""tribunal established by law"", he does appear to have raised in substance most of the matters which form the basis of his complaints in relation to these two provisions."
189,"Thus, in the Commission’s decision on admissibility, he is reported as referring in particular to the facts that the members of the court martial were appointed ad hoc, that the judge advocate’s advice on sentencing was not disclosed, that no reasons were given for the decisions taken by the court-martial board and the confirming and reviewing officers, and that the post-hearing reviews were essentially administrative in nature and conducted in private (see the Commission’s decision on admissibility, application no. 22107/93, pp. 32 35)."
190,"since they involved the determination of Mr Findlay’s sentence following his plea of guilty to criminal charges; indeed, this point was not disputed before it"
191,"(see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 18 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 33-36, paras. 80-85, and the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 34-35, paras. 76-77)."
192,"because, inter alia, all the officers appointed to it were directly subordinate to the convening officer who also performed the role of prosecuting authority"
193,"The lack of legal qualification or experience in the officers making the decisions either at the court martial or review stages made it impossible for them to act in an independent or impartial manner."
194,"because the statutory framework according to which it proceeded was too vague and imprecise; for example, it was silent on the question of how the convening officer, confirming officer and reviewing authorities were to be appointed."
195,"  The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay’s case."
196,He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate.
197,"He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above)."
198,"Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible."
199,"He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those ""reasonably requested"" by the defence."
200,"His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above)."
201," The question therefore arises whether the members of the court martial were sufficiently independent of the convening officer and whether the organisation of the trial offered adequate guarantees of impartiality."
202," It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above)."
203,"Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above)."
204,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Sramek v. Austria judgment of 22 October 1984, Series A no. 84, p. 20, para. 42)."
205,". Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified "
206," In addition, the Court finds it significant that the convening officer also acted as ""confirming officer""."
207,"The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above)."
208,Nor could the defects referred to above (in paragraphs 75 and 77) be corrected by any subsequent review proceedings. 
209,"(see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, pp. 16-18, paras. 31-32)."
210," First, there were no grounds for believing that the applicant would not have been convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and dismissed from the army following his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), even if the court martial had been differently organised."
211,"Secondly, it was in any case unlikely that he would have enjoyed a long career in the army, in view of the post traumatic stress disorder and back injury from which he suffered (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 30 above); he had already received GBP 100,000 in settlement of his civil claim against the Ministry of Defence, a large part of which related to loss of earning capacity."
212,"At the hearing, the Commission’s Delegate observed that no causal link had been established between the breach of the Convention complained of by the applicant and the alleged pecuniary damage, and submitted that it was not possible to speculate as to whether the proceedings would have led to a different outcome had they fulfilled the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
213,"(see, for example, the Schmautzer v. Austria judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328-A, p. 16, para. 44)."
214,"The complaint concerning Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement
64.   In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. The Judge Advocate General, Judge Rant, had commented: ""These are extremely serious allegations ..."".
In a later letter, Judge Rant wrote:
""I wish to make it clear that, at this stage and without prejudice to any action which might have to be taken in the future, I am making no formal complaint about the passage [from the applicant’s submission to the Commission] quoted in that letter. The reason for this is that the case of Findlay is to be argued before the European Court of Human Rights in September 1996 and therefore it is only proper for me to defer action until the end of those proceedings."""
215,"In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. "
216,"(see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 15, para. 37)."
217,"For these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities."
218,"Thus, the decision of the court martial was not effective until ratified by him, and he had the power to vary the sentence imposed as he saw fit (see paragraph 48 above). This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of ""tribunal"" and can also be seen as a component of the ""independence"" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45)."
219,"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)"
220," Article 26 (art. 26) provides:
""The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken."""
221," The Government contended that the rule relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies was clearly established in international law and in the case-law of the Convention organs,"
222,"In fact, Mr Aksoy could have had recourse to three different types of domestic remedy: a criminal prosecution, a civil action and/or administrative proceedings (see paragraphs 24-28 above)."
223, required the applicant to avail himself of all national remedies unless these clearly offered him no chance of success. 
224,"With regard to the first of these options, they submitted that he could have complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the public prosecutor who saw him on 10 December 1992 (see paragraph 18 above)."
225,"Articles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code, which were in force throughout Turkey, penalised the use of torture and ill-treatment for the extraction of confessions (see paragraph 24 above)."
226,Legislative Decree no. 285 on the state of emergency region transferred the power to carry out investigations into criminal acts allegedly committed by civil servants from the public prosecutors to the administrative councils (see paragraph 26 above).
227,"However, decisions by the administrative councils not to prosecute were always reviewed by the Supreme Administrative Court."
228,They therefore drew the Court’s attention to the existence of an administrative remedy under Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution (see paragraph 27 above).
229,"In order to receive compensation under this provision, an individual needed only to show that there was a causal link between the acts committed by the administration and the wrong suffered; there was no requirement to prove serious misconduct on the part of a government agent."
230,"In this connection, the Government submitted examples of administrative decisions in which compensation had been awarded in respect of death caused by torture in police custody."
231,"  In addition, the Government argued that Mr Aksoy could have brought a civil action for damages."
232,"Again, they referred to a number of decisions of the domestic courts, including a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a case concerning a claim for damages for torture, where it was held that offences committed by members of the security forces were governed by the Code of Obligations and that, under Article 53 of that Code, an acquittal for lack of evidence in criminal proceedings was not binding on the civil courts."
233,"In particular, he argued that reports by a number of international bodies showing that the torture of detainees continued to be systematic and widespread in Turkey raised questions about the commitment of the State to bringing an end to this practice."
234,In this respect he referred to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s Public Statement on Turkey (15 December 1992); the United Nations Committee against Torture’s Summary Account of the Results of the Proceedings Concerning the Inquiry on Turkey (9 November 1993); and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture’s Report of 1995 
235,"Furthermore, lawyers and others who acted for the victims of human rights violations were subjected to threats, intimidation and abusive prosecutions and individuals were afraid to pursue domestic remedies because reprisals against complainants were so common."
236,"In these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he should not be required to pursue domestic remedies before making a complaint to Strasbourg."
237," In any case, he maintained that he had informed the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992 that he had been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and asserted that, even if he had not, the prosecutor could plainly have observed that he did not have the proper use of his hands."
238,The failure of the prosecutor to start a criminal investigation made it extremely difficult for the applicant to avail himself of any domestic remedy.
239,"It followed that, although it was not possible to establish exactly what happened during his meeting with the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992, there must undoubtedly have been elements which should have prompted the latter to open an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information about the applicant’s state of health and the treatment to which he had been subjected."
240," In addition, this failure prejudiced his chances of victory in civil or administrative proceedings, because in order to succeed with either type of claim it would have been necessary to prove that he had suffered torture, and in practice a ruling to that effect by a judge in criminal proceedings would have been required."
241," Finally, he reminded the Court that no remedy was available even in theory in relation to his complaint regarding the length of time he was detained without judicial control, since this was perfectly lawful under the domestic legislation (see paragraph 29 above)."
242, The Commission was of the opinion that the applicant had been injured during his time in police custody (see paragraph 23 above).
243,"Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. "
244,"Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism."
245," These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State."
246,"In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65)."
247,The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system.
248,"The Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of ill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting."
249,"However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in Turkish law he was under a duty to investigate (see paragraph 26 above)."
250,It must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police custody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support.
251,During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment (see paragraph 23 above).
252,"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State."
253,"For example, they questioned why the applicant had made no complaint to the public prosecutor about having been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and found it difficult to understand why, if he had indeed been subjected to torture, he had not made any inculpatory confession."
254,They also found it suspicious that he had waited for five days between being released from police custody and contacting the hospital (see paragraph 19 above) and observed that it could not be assumed that nothing untoward had occurred in the meantime.
255,"Finally, they raised a number of points relating to the medical evidence, including the facts that the applicant took his medical records with him when he left hospital and that there was no medical evidence of burns or other marks left by the application of electric shocks."
256," The Court considers, in the light of all the material before it, that the particular extent and impact of PKK terrorist activity in South-East Turkey has undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a ""public emergency threatening the life of the nation"" "
257,"It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of ""promptness""."
258," Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable."
259,"The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:
""1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...
...
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ..."""
260,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, p. 56, para. 28, the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 78, para. 205, and the above-mentioned Brannigan and McBride judgment, p. 50, para. 47)."
261," The Court recalls its decision in the case of Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, p. 33, para. 62), that a period of detention without judicial control of four days and six hours fell outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3)."
262," By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of the derogations necessary to avert it."
263,"Nonetheless, Contracting Parties do not enjoy an unlimited discretion."
264,"It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, the States have gone beyond the ""extent strictly required by the exigencies"" of the crisis."
265,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, p. 56, para. 28, the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 78, para. 205, and the above-mentioned Brannigan and McBride judgment, p. 50, para. 47)."
266,"The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty."
267,"Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law "
268,"(see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, p. 32, para. 58). "
269," In the Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68 above), the Court held that the United Kingdom Government had not exceeded their margin of appreciation by derogating from their obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) to the extent that individuals suspected of terrorist offences were allowed to be held for up to seven days without judicial control."
270,"Furthermore, prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of serious ill treatment, which, as stated above (paragraph 62), is prohibited by the Convention in absolute and non-derogable terms."
271,who was detained over a long period of time.
272,"In particular, the denial of access to a lawyer, doctor, relative or friend and the absence of any realistic possibility of being brought before a court to test the legality of the detention meant that he was left completely at the mercy of those holding him."
273," the Court considers that in this case insufficient safeguards were available to the applicant,"
274," Accordingly, in view in particular of the lack of any investigation, the Court finds that the applicant was denied an effective remedy in respect of his allegation of torture."
275," In the Court’s view, against this background, it is more appropriate to consider this complaint in relation to the more general obligation on States under Article 13 (art. 13) to provide an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention.
2. Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13)"
276,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 (art. 13) must be ""effective"" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State."
277,"Indeed, under Turkish law the prosecutor was under a duty to carry out an investigation."
278,"The Court recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) embodies the ""right to a court"", of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, for example, the Holy Monasteries v. Greece judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 36-37, para. 80)."
279,"There can be no doubt that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applies to a civil claim for compensation in respect of ill treatment allegedly committed by agents of the State (see, for example, the Tomasi judgment cited at paragraph 61 above, p. 43, paras. 121-22)."
280,"The Court recalls, however, that because of the special circumstances which existed in his case (see paragraph 57 above), Mr Aksoy did not even attempt to make an application before the civil courts."
281,"(see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1219, para. 105)."
282, The Court reiterates that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) that applicants or potential applicants are able to communicate freely with the Commission without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints
283,"That being so, in the present case the Commission was unable to find any evidence to show that Mr Aksoy’s death was connected with his application, or that the State authorities had been responsible for any interference, in the form of threats or intimidation, with his rights under Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1), and no new evidence in this connection was presented to the Court."
284,"The respondent Government, both in that case and the present case, submitted to the Commission in the first place and later to the European Court - both in their memorial and at the public hearing - dozens of judgments of the courts of first instance or the supreme courts such as the Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court.
7.   Most of these judgments concerned cases in south-eastern Turkey where acts of terrorism are being committed and where the present case occurred. The following examples give a brief summary of some of these decisions."
285,"I consider that ""where there is doubt"", and especially where there is doubt, domestic remedies must be exhausted as required by the Commission (decision of 14 March 1985, Garcia v. Switzerland, application no. 10148/82, Decisions and Reports 42, p. 98). And the applicant did nothing of the sort."
286,"The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67)."
287, The Court emphasises that its approach to the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. 
288,"(see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67)."
289,He referred to medical evidence from Dicle University Medical Faculty which showed that he was suffering from a bilateral brachial plexus injury at the time of his admission to hospital (see paragraph 19 above).
290,"This injury was consistent with Palestinian hanging.

291," He claimed to have been kept blindfolded during interrogation, which caused disorientation; to have been suspended from his arms, which were tied together behind his back (""Palestinian hanging""); to have been given electric shocks, which were exacerbated by throwing water over him; and to have been subjected to beatings, slapping and verbal abuse."
292,He submitted that the treatment complained of was sufficiently severe as to amount to torture; it was inflicted with the purpose of inducing him to admit that he knew the man who had identified him.
293,"In addition, he contended that the conditions in which he was detained (see paragraph 13 above) and the constant fear of torture which he suffered while in custody amounted to inhuman treatment."
294,"Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
295,"In order to determine whether any particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction drawn in Article 3 (art. 3) between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment."
296,"The Court recalls that the Commission found, inter alia, that the applicant was subjected to ""Palestinian hanging"", in other words, that he was stripped naked, with his arms tied together behind his back, and suspended by his arms (see paragraph 23 above).
In the view of the Court this treatment could only have been deliberately inflicted; indeed, a certain amount of preparation and exertion would have been required to carry it out."
297, It would appear to have been administered with the aim of obtaining admissions or information from the applicant.
298," In addition to the severe pain which it must have caused at the time, the medical evidence shows that it led to a paralysis of both arms which lasted for some time (see paragraph 23 above)."
299,"Article 3 (art. 3), as the Court has observed on many occasions, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society."
300,The Court considers that this treatment was of such a serious and cruel nature that it can only be described as torture.
301," In addition, according to the ""generally recognised rules of international law"" to which Article 26 (art. 26) makes reference, there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal."
302,"(see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65)."
303,"The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law."
304,"He stated that there was a policy on the part of the State authorities of denying that torture ever took place, which made it extremely difficult for victims to succeed in receiving compensation and in having those responsible brought to justice."
305,"For example, it was now impossible for individuals alleging torture to obtain medical reports proving the extent of their injuries, because the forensic medical service had been reorganised and doctors who issued such reports were either threatened or moved to a different area."
306,Prosecutors in the state of emergency region routinely failed to open investigations into alleged abuses of human rights and frequently refused even to acknowledge complaints.
307,Such investigations as were carried out were biased and inadequate.
308,The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the fundamental values of a democratic society.
309,"Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms treatment contrary to this provision."
310,Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.
311,The assessment of this minimum is relative:
312,"it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim "
313,"(see Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 909, §§ 75-76)."
314,"it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim "
315,"The Court notes that the applicant’s home was burned down before the eyes of members of his family, depriving them of shelter and support and obliging them to leave their home and friends."
316,The Court considers that the destruction of the applicant’s home and possessions in the above circumstances must have caused him suffering of sufficient severity for the acts of the security forces to be categorised as inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3
317,"(see Selçuk and Asker, cited above, p. 910, §§ 77-78)."
318,"(see in this respect Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, nos. 23184/94 and 23185/94, Commission’s report of 28 November 1996, §§ 185-187)."
319, The notion of security of person has not been given an independent interpretation
320, The Court recalls that the primary concern of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is protection from an arbitrary deprivation of liberty.
321,"The notion of security of person has not been given an independent interpretation (see in this respect Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, nos. 23184/94 and 23185/94, Commission’s report of 28 November 1996, §§ 185-187)."
322,"The Court has found it established that the security forces deliberately destroyed the applicant’s house and property, obliging his family to leave their village (see paragraph 47 above). "
323,"There is no doubt that these acts, in addition to giving rise to a violation of Article 3, constituted a grave and unjustified interference with the applicant’s rights to respect for his private and family life and home, and to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 28 November 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2711, § 73, and Dulaş v. Turkey, no. 25801/94, § 60, 30 January 2001)."
324," In respect of this second part of the domestic investigation, the Court considers that the authorities who were responsible for the investigation lacked the requisite independence and impartiality."
325,It is also clear from the witness testimonies that the Kulp District Gendarme Commander further delegated the Kulp Gendarme Station Commander to conduct the investigation. 
326,"Given the seriousness of the allegations, the Court is of the opinion that the public prosecutor was under an obligation to gather and record evidence which would help to shed light on the facts of the incident."
327,"However, it is noted that the public prosecutor’s investigation was limited to taking statements from the three complainants."
328,"It does not appear that any attempt was made to carry out an on-site inspection at the scene of the incident, to establish the true version of the facts through questioning other villagers who might have witnessed the events or to interview the members of security forces who were allegedly involved in the incident."
329," It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"".  The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"".  The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape."
330,"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above). "
331," The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 14 and 20-25 above)."
332,"Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape. "
333,"The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above)."
334," What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom. "
335,"(see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37)."
336,"   The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency."
337,"It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment."
338,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. "
339,"(see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37)"
340,"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation.  There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition"
341,From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.
342,"In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable."
343,"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability"
344,"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation.  There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. "
345,"The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant’s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. "
346," Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied."
347,"Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law."
348,They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes. 
349,"To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent. "
350,"Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred.  In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary."
351,The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape.
352,This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable.
353,"In particular, given the recognition of women’s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant."
354,"In addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse. "
355,"A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity."
356,"It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted."
357,"The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law.
When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed.  On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon.  In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created."
358,"In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect.
On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above)."
359,"However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). "
360,"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7)"
361,"(see the Artico v. Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 12-13, paras. 24 and 27)."
362,not having applied for judicial review either of the Inspectors’ conduct of the inquiry or of their decision to submit their report to the Secretary of State;
363,by not having applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision to publish the Inspectors’ report;
364,"by not having pursued the libel proceedings commenced against The Observer newspaper."
365,"The grounds on which judicial review may be sought (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) are such that it would not have ensured access to a court for determination of the truth of statements made about the applicants in the Inspectors’ report, the absence of such access being the essence of their complaints under the Convention."
366,"Nor would the libel actions against The Observer, although to some extent concerned with the same subject-matter (see paragraph 11 above), have provided a remedy against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State as regards the publication of the damaging statements contained in the Inspectors’ report."
367," The applicants contended that the Inspectors’ investigation and, above all, the publication of the Inspectors’ report gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which, in so far as relevant, provides:"
368,"The first stage of the applicants’ argument, which was disputed by the Government and not accepted by the Commission, was that"
369," In order for an individual to be entitled to a hearing before a tribunal, there must exist a ""dispute"" (""contestation"") over one of his or her civil rights or obligations."
370,"(see, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 20-22, paras. 44-50)."
371,"the respondent Government did not dispute the existence and ""civil"" character of the right under English law to a good reputation."
372,"The principal purpose of the investigation and report of the Inspectors, they maintained, was to acquire, marshal and set down factual information which would enable the various competent authorities - such as the Director General of Fair Trading, the prosecuting authorities, the Bank of England, the Takeover Panel and the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 23, 27, 30 and 34 above) - to decide what action, if any, to take. "
373,"Four further purposes also existed, none of which, however, included ascertaining whether the applicants merited their good reputation. These additional purposes were dispelling public speculation about the events surrounding the takeover, enabling those concerned in takeovers to learn lessons, laying the foundations for reform of company law and practice, and providing information to HOF’s employees, shareholders and creditors."
374,"The Commission, after analysing the purposes served by the preparation and publication of the Inspectors’ report, came to the conclusion that the Inspectors had an ""investigative rather than determinative"" role (paragraph 64 of the Commission’s report)."
375,The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above).
376,"The Act confers on the Inspectors wide powers to obtain information and obstruction of the Inspectors may, upon reference by them to a court, be treated by it as a contempt of court and punished accordingly (sections 434 and 436 of the Act - see paragraph 38 above)."
377,"The principal question addressed by the Inspectors in the instant case can be reduced to whether the Fayed brothers had dishonestly misled the authorities and the public in order to obtain Government clearance and acceptance by the HOF Board of their bid (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The Inspectors’ published findings - that the applicants had indeed made dishonest representations concerning their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources and had thereafter knowingly submitted false evidence to the Inspectors (see paragraph 22 above) - undoubtedly damaged the applicants’ reputations."
378,"The competent Ministers and a Parliamentary Select Committee - quite apart, it can be supposed, from a substantial section of public opinion - showed a disposition to accept as correct these findings, publication of which was seen as a kind of sanction (see paragraphs 26, 30, 31, 33 and 34 above).
Such elements or consequences are, it is true, not infrequently found in the context of adjudicatory proceedings."
379,"However, the Court is satisfied that the functions performed by the Inspectors were, in practice as well as in theory, essentially investigative"
380,(see the similar analysis by the Supreme Court of the United States of America of the function of the Federal Civil Rights Commission in the case of Hannah v. Larche (363 US 420 (1960)).
381,They themselves said in their report that their findings would not be dispositive of anything (see paragraph 21 above).
382,"They did not make a legal determination as to criminal or civil liability concerning the Fayed brothers, and in particular concerning the latter’s civil right to honour and reputation."
383,"The purpose of their inquiry was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities - prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative."
384,"Lonrho admittedly exhibited a clear interest in the inquiry and its outcome, by being instrumental in bringing about the appointment of the Inspectors, by submitting evidence and by seeking to prompt action by the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 12 in fine, 13, 19, 24, 25 and 35 above)."
385,"Nonetheless, whilst there was a close connection between Lonrho’s grievance against the Fayed brothers and the matters investigated by the Inspectors (see, inter alia, paragraphs 10-13 and 22 above), the object of the proceedings before the Inspectors was not to resolve any dispute (contestation) between Lonrho and the applicants. "
386,"Those disputes, and in particular the applicants’ libel claims that Lonrho, through The Observer, had wrongfully damaged their reputations, were being adjudicated by the ordinary courts (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above)."
387,"Likewise, no dispute (contestation) between the Secretary of State or the Inspectors and the applicants as to the lawfulness of any alleged interference with the applicants’ right to reputation arose merely because the applicants contested the grounds on which the Minister decided to appoint the Inspectors and on which the Inspectors conducted their lines of inquiry."
388,"The Inspectors described Lonrho and the Fayed brothers as ""bitterly antagonistic parties"" (see paragraph 19 in fine above)."
389,"In short, it cannot be said that the Inspectors’ inquiry ""determined"" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation, for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or that its result was directly decisive for that right."
390, Acceptance of the applicants’ argument would entail that a body carrying out preparatory investigations at the instance of regulatory or other authorities should always be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) by reason of the fact that publication of its findings is liable to damage the reputation of the individuals whose conduct is being investigated.
391,"The Inspectors did not adjudicate, either in form or in substance."
392,Such an interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities.
393,"In the words of the Court’s Golder judgment, ""... Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal."
394,"In this way the Article (art. 6-1) embodies the ‘right to a court’, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only"" (loc. cit., p. 18, para. 36)."
395,"This right to a court ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law;"
396,"  In the Government’s submission, the defence of privilege delimited the very content of the applicants’ right to a good reputation as protected under English law."
397,"They maintained that, unlike procedural barriers to access to court, such an exercise by the State of the power to fix the content of a particular civil right did not bring into play Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), although it might on occasions raise an issue in relation to one or other of the substantive rights protected by the Convention (such as the right to respect for private life under Article 8) (art. 8)."
398,  It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law.
399,"It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy."
400,"If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do"
401,"The Court therefore proposes to proceed on the basis that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable to the facts of the case, the argument before the Court having been directed solely to this Article."
402," On this approach, it has to be ascertained whether the contested limitation on the applicants’ ability to take legal proceedings to challenge the findings and conclusions in the Inspectors’ report which were damaging to their reputations satisfied the conditions stated in the Court’s case-law."
403,"(see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 19-20, para. 41)"
404,"The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985."
405,The underlying aim of this system is clearly the furtherance of the public interest in the proper conduct of the affairs of public companies whose owners benefit from limited liability.
406,"Considerations of public interest dictate both the appointment of Inspectors and the publication or not of their report (see paragraphs 36, 40 and 41 above)."
407,"The system contributes to safeguarding the interests of the various parties concerned in the affairs of public companies such as investors, shareholders, especially small shareholders, creditors, customers, trading partners and employees, as well as ensuring the overall soundness and credibility of the country’s company law structures."
408,"In the words of the Commission’s report (at paragraph 64), ""it is ... necessary in a democratic society that governments exercise supervisory controls over large commercial activities in order to ensure good management practices and the transparency of honest dealings""."
409,"As regards the particular facts complained of by the applicant brothers, the Court accepts as accurate the Government’s analysis of the purposes served by the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report (see paragraphs 28 and 58 above - see also paragraphs 13, 14 and 30 above as regards the particular facts)."
410,"The investigation into the affairs of HOFH and the publication of the resultant report in themselves therefore pursued legitimate aims."
411,"As to the contested limitation on the ability to take legal proceedings, it was common ground that any defamation action brought by the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State would have been successfully met with a defence of privilege, be it absolute or qualified (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above)."
412,The rationale of this defence is that statements which harm an individual’s reputation and which would otherwise give rise to liability should benefit from total or partial immunity because their author or publisher is acting in furtherance of some overriding interest of social importance (see paragraph 42 above).
413,"As regards more specifically investigations under the Companies Act, the British courts have explained that ""the public interest demands"" that ""Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness"" (per Lord Denning in re Pergamon Press Ltd - see paragraph 43 above)."
414,"Whilst continuing to maintain that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued, they stressed that their complaint was not directed against the defence of privilege as such. They were not asserting a right to hold the Inspectors or the Secretary of State personally liable for damages in a suit for defamation; nor were they arguing that such independent reports into the affairs of public companies should never be prepared or published."
415,"Rather their claim was that where a report by organs of the State has branded an individual as being guilty of wrongdoing such as dishonesty after a procedure not attended by the procedural guarantees of a fair trial, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) grants the individual whose reputation is at stake the right to challenge the findings against him or her in a court of law before publication of the report. "
416,"Accepting that a cause of action based on libel was barred and that judicial review did not provide the desired remedy, some other form of effective access to the courts should have been available to them for this purpose by virtue of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
417,"The English legal system, in their view, lacked adequate safeguards to protect their civil right to honour and reputation against misuse of their powers by the Inspectors and the Secretary of State."
418,"As to enforcement of the right to a good reputation under domestic law, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to businessmen"
419,"Persons, such as the applicants, who fall into the former category of businessmen inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts, not only by the press but also and above all by bodies representing the public interest (ibid.)."
420,"(see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 26, para. 59)"
421," An additional point to note as concerns the particular circumstances of the present case is that the findings in the Inspectors’ report to which the applicants took exception related to matters which the applicants themselves had made great efforts to bring into the public domain, namely their family background, their personal wealth and their business activities (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above)."
422,"The beneficial public reputation which the applicants enjoyed in late 1984 and early 1985 was largely the result of an active public relations campaign which they undertook with the assistance of their advisers, and it played a crucial role in facilitating clearance of their bid for HOF."
423,"Thereafter the applicants were at pains to stifle any publicity adverse to this favourable reputation which they had themselves largely created, as is shown by their threatened or actual libel actions against various newspapers, notably The Observer (see paragraph 11 above)."
424," In any event, in their argument to the Court the applicants did not suggest that either the Inspectors or the successive Secretaries of State had acted with malicious intent, which would have destroyed a defence of qualified privilege."
425," In arriving at their findings of fact or conclusions, the Inspectors were under a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they proposed to criticise in their report a fair opportunity to answer the allegations against them."
426,"The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above)."
427,"In the latter connection, judicial review would have provided relief if it could have been established that the Inspectors had made findings of fact not properly based on material with probative value, or reached conclusions which there were no facts to support, or taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations, or reached conclusions which no reasonable person in their position could have reached (ibid.)."
428,"Judicial review would not, it is true, have provided the applicants with ""the effective remedy"" to which they were claiming to be entitled under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), namely a remedy enabling them to argue before a court that the Inspectors’ findings of fact were simply erroneous."
429,"Whilst Inspectors are accorded broad freedom in reporting on the affairs of public companies, the performance of their investigative functions is attended by not inconsiderable safeguards intended to ensure a fair procedure and the reliability of findings of fact."
430,"Extremely serious accusations were levelled against the Inspectors by the applicants in the press release issued by them on the day of the publication of the Inspectors’ report, including accusations of dishonesty, prejudice, non-respect of agreed procedures, unfairness and total disregard of the principles of natural justice (see paragraph 32 above)."
431,"In correspondence with the authorities the applicants had previously been consistently threatening to take legal action to contest the report and its publication; yet in the event they did not do so, despite a formal undertaking on behalf of the Secretary of State to hold up publication if proceedings were brought (see paragraph 29 above)."
432,"As the Government pointed out, a reading of the Inspectors’ report shows that the applicants were made aware of the information required of them and were given every reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them and to furnish evidence, notwithstanding their last-minute procedural request to the Inspectors (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."
433,"The applicants pointed out that the Inspectors’ report containing findings of dishonesty was published, with the benefit of protection from liability in defamation, even though the authorities decided that there was no cause for instituting either criminal or civil proceedings (see paragraphs 23, 27, 28 and 30 above)."
434,"The Court has also taken note of the evidence submitted by the applicants showing that there is a body of informed opinion in the United Kingdom which believes that these consequences of the system enacted by Parliament in the Companies Act 1985 are not desirable."
435," It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard."
436,"The risk of some uncompensated damage to reputation is inevitable if independent investigators in circumstances such as those of the present case are to have the necessary freedom to report without fear, not only to the authorities but also in the final resort to the public."
437,It is in the first place for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual’s interest in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the community’s interest in independent investigation of the affairs of large public companies. 
438,"The applicants’ argument would amount to reading into Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) an entitlement to have a report such as the one in the present case not published until after a full judicial hearing repeating, doubtless over a longer time-scale, the same fact-finding exercise as that already carried out by the Inspectors."
439,Such an entitlement could effectively destroy the utility of informing the public of the results of the administrative investigations provided for under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985.
440,"Having found the aim of not only making but also publishing Inspectors’ reports to be legitimate, the Court cannot apply the test of proportionality in such a way as to render publication impracticable."
441,"The contested limitation was thus concerned with an investigation of circumstances offered to public scrutiny by persons who had themselves sought a public profile through their bid to take over a large public company."
442,"Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as ""the rules of natural justice"" (see paragraph 39 above)."
443,"Nonetheless, the manner in which findings detrimental to a person’s reputation are arrived at in an administrative investigation, as well as the objectives pursued by the investigation, is relevant for assessing the permissibility under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of a limitation on the person’s opportunities to go to court to enforce his or her civil right to reputation."
444,"Safeguards afforded to the applicants throughout the investigation included constant consultation by the Inspectors as regards the structure, procedure and lines of inquiry of the investigation, the professional representation of the applicants, at interviews as well as in the submission of evidence and argument, and the Inspectors’ concern to respect the applicants’ personal privacy as much as possible (see paragraphs 15 to 18 and 20 above)."
445," In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court cannot find that, in the exercise of their responsibility of regulating the conduct of the affairs of public companies, the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation to limit the applicant brothers’ access to the courts under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the state of the applicable law or as regards the effects of the application of that law to the brothers."
446," The starting-point for the Court’s reasoning is its doctrine that Article 6 (art. 6) ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law"" (paragraph 65).
5.    In my concurring opinion in the case of Salerno v. Italy (judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 245-D, pp. 57 et seq.), I examined the genesis of this doctrine. In paragraph 3.4 of that opinion I recalled that the doctrine had been fundamentally criticised on repeated occasions by several judges , but I left open whether I too subscribed to that criticism. I came to the conclusion that in any event there was no room for the ""arguable claim"" test where the applicant has in fact had access to a court which has decided on the merits of his claim: a decision on a non-arguable claim should also meet the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
447,"The present case demonstrates that also within the context of an access-to-court issue the ""arguable claim"" test is an unfortunate feature of the Court’s case-law ."
448,"It has obliged the Court to adopt a reasoning whose subtleness, to my mind, seems hardly convincing."
449,"  In my opinion the Court’s reasoning would have been simpler and more persuasive without all this meandering necessitated by its maintaining the ""arguable claim"" test: there could be no doubt as to the applicants’ right to reputation having been damaged."
450,"Whether or not a right to reputation is enshrined in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is immaterial, since such a right does exist, at least in principle, under all our national laws and it has not been contended that in this respect English law makes an exception by clearly and fully excluding such a right."
451,"Neither can there be doubt as to the right to reputation being a ""civil"" right within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
452,"It follows that under this provision, whenever a person’s reputation has been interfered with, he or she is in principle entitled to access to a court meeting its requirements."
453,"In the applicants’ submission, one of the objects of the inquiry by the Inspectors was to make findings as to whether the applicants were guilty of misconduct and the central conclusion of the report was that the applicants had dishonestly misled the authorities."
454,"Even though the Inspectors’ role may in theory have been investigative, the manner in which they performed their functions in the present case was in fact determinative."
455,"The Inspectors’ report, published to the world at large, had the force of a judgment convicting the applicants of dishonesty."
456," Having regard to the cases of Golder v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 13, para. 27) and Helmers v. Sweden (judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 14, para. 27),"
457,"(see, inter alia, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, para. 81; and the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p.16, para. 36)."
458,"[Article 6 para. 1] (art. 6-1) does not in itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ in the substantive law of the Contracting States"""
459,"Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court."
460,In the latter kind of case Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may have a degree of applicability.
461,Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned.
462,"The relevant principles have been stated by the Court as follows:"
463,"The right of access to the courts secured by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access ‘by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals’."
464," In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, but the final decision as to observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court."
465,"(see, inter alia, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, para. 81; and the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p.16, para. 36)."
466,"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations......, everyone is entitled to a fair...hearing within reasonable time... by[a]... tribunal”"
467,"As regards the first set of proceedings, the period to be taken into consideration began on 3 January 1990 and ended on 22 May 1999."
468,"Thus, they lasted more than nine years and four months. "
469,"As regards the second set of proceedings, the period to be taken into consideration began on 4 September 1990 and ended on 25 February 1999."
470,"Thus, they lasted for more than eight years and five months."
471,The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.
472,It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds.
473,"(see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII)."
474,"The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute"
475,"The Court considers that the present proceedings can clearly be distinguished from the custody proceedings, as they concerned merely the fixing of maintenance payments and were not particularly complex. "
476,As regards the conduct of the applicant the Court has consistently held that applicants cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to them under domestic law.
477,"However, an applicant's behaviour constitutes an objective fact which cannot be attributed to the respondent State and which must be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether or not the reasonable time referred to in Article 6 § 1 has been exceeded"
478,"In the present case, the Court acknowledges that the applicant had filed numerous requests, complaints and motions and had repeatedly failed to obey the authorities' summons."
479,"Although such conduct contributed to prolonging the proceedings, it is not in itself sufficient to explain the length of the extensive proceedings. "
480,"  On the other hand, the Court notes that there are substantial delays attributable to the authorities."
481,"In particular, in the first set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of more than two years (from 3 January 1990 to 10 February 1992) while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further one of six years (from 13 May 1992 to 20 May 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal."
482,"The Court cannot find that the Government has given sufficient explanation for these delays that occurred."
483,"In the second set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of some three years (from 4 September 1990 to 10 August 1993), while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further such period of three years and seven months (from 5 January 1995 to 5 August 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal."
484,"(see Erkner and Hofbauer v. Austria, no. 9616/81, Commission decision of 23 April 1987, A 117, § 68) "
485,"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention."
486,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
487,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
488,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison."
489,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
490,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions."
491,"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).  "
492," In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
493,"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision (art. 64)."
494,"Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  "
495," Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
496,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here"
497,"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
498,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions (art. 5, art. 64) applied in the present case are covered by that reservation.  "
499,"They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case."
500,"The Court notes that Mr Gradinger based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
501,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
502,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied."
503,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
504,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
505,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
506,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority. "
507,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  "
508,"(see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
509,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  "
510,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"""
511,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
512,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
513,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
514,"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
515,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
516,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
517," Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 26 above).  "
518,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 24, para. 49)."
519,"(see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 20)."
520," the Court considers that the ""declaration"" is to be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention"
521,"It is therefore necessary to determine whether the declaration satisfies the requirements of that provision (art. 64).  "
522," The Court notes at the outset that there is no ""brief statement"" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4)."
523,"Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the ""declaration"" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not ""criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure"" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this."
524,"Nevertheless, with a description of this nature, which is not exhaustive, the ""declaration"" does not afford to a sufficient degree ""a guarantee ... that [it] does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded"" by Austria"
525,"Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision."
526,That provision (P7-4) does not therefore apply before new proceedings have been opened.
527,"In the present case, inasmuch as the new proceedings reached their conclusion in a decision later in date than the entry into force of Protocol No. 7 (P7), namely the Administrative Court's judgment of 29 March 1989,"
528,"The latter were different in nature and pursued different aims: whereas Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code punished homicide committed while under the influence of drink, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act punished the mere fact of driving a vehicle while intoxicated."
529,"The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. "
530," The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant. "
531,"On the other hand, the administrative authorities found, in order to bring the applicant's case within the ambit of section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, that that alcohol level had been attained."
532,"The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose."
533,It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.
534," Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct."
535,"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
536,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  
537,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
538," In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above)."
539,"He relied on Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides: 
""1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his ... family life ... 
2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."" "
540,"It cannot therefore be claimed that the bond of ""family life"" between them has been broken. "
541," In any event, Switzerland was in no way responsible for the situation the Gül family was in."
542," Having regard to all these considerations, and while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1). "
543,"Admittedly, Mr Gül left Turkey in 1983, when his son Ersin was only three months old (see paragraph 7 above);"
544,"Mrs Gül left Ersin in 1987 because of her accident (see paragraph 8 above)."
545,"However, after obtaining a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in Switzerland in 1990, the applicant asked the Swiss authorities for permission to bring the boy, who was then six years old, to Switzerland (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). "
546,"Subsequently, he repeatedly asked the Swiss courts to allow his son to join him, before bringing his case before the Convention institutions."
547,"Despite the distance, in geographical terms, between them, the applicant has made a number of visits to Turkey, the last of these being in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
548,"Mr Gül had left Turkey when his younger son Ersin was three months old, and had never attempted to develop a family life in his country of origin."
549,"In addition, the focus of that son’s family life was in Turkey since, even after his mother’s departure, the child had been taken in as a member of his elder brother’s family.  "
550,"Furthermore, the fact that Mr and Mrs Gül’s daughter Nursal had been placed in a home in Switzerland showed that they were in any event incapable of assuming their parental responsibilities with regard to the boy. "
551," (see, most recently, the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, para. 49, and the Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 October 1994, Series A no. 297-C, p. 56, para. 31)."
552, In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation
553,The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.
554,"There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective ""respect"" for family life."
555,"However, the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under this provision (art. 8) do not lend themselves to precise definition."
556,"The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar."
557,"other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67)."
558,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 32, para. 88). "
559,"The applicant left Turkey in 1983 and made his way to Switzerland, where he applied for political asylum; this application was rejected by the Minister for Refugees in 1989 (see paragraph 10 above)."
560,His wife joined him in 1987 so that she could receive medical treatment in Switzerland after a serious accident.
561,Their daughter Nursal was placed from birth in a home in Switzerland and has remained there ever since (see paragraph 9 above).
562,In 1990 Mr and Mrs Gül were granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and then sought permission to bring their son Ersin to Switzerland.
563,"Ersin has always lived in Turkey (see paragraph 19 above). "
564,"By leaving Turkey in 1983, Mr Gül caused the separation from his son, and he was unable to prove to the Swiss authorities - who refused to grant him political refugee status - that he personally had been a victim of persecution in his home country."
565,"In any event, whatever the applicant’s initial reasons for applying for political asylum, the visits he has made to his son in recent years tend to show that they are no longer valid."
566,"His counsel, moreover, expressly confirmed this at the hearing. "
567,"In addition, according to the Government, by virtue of a social security convention concluded on 1 May 1969 between Switzerland and Turkey, the applicant could continue to receive his ordinary invalidity pension and half of the supplementary benefit he receives at present in respect of his wife, his son Ersin and his daughter Nursal if he returned to his home country (see paragraph 23 above)."
568,"Mrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic, since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds."
569,"However, although her state of health seemed particularly alarming in 1987, when her accident occurred, it has not been proved that she could not later have received appropriate medical treatment in specialist hospitals in Turkey. "
570,"She was, moreover, able to visit Turkey with her husband in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above)."
571,"Furthermore, although Mr and Mrs Gül are lawfully resident in Switzerland, they do not have a permanent right of abode, as they do not have a settlement permit but merely a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which could be withdrawn, and which under Swiss law does not give them a right to family reunion (see paragraph 18 above). "
572,"  In view of the length of time Mr and Mrs Gül have lived in Switzerland, it would admittedly not be easy for them to return to Turkey, but there are, strictly speaking, no obstacles preventing them from developing family life in Turkey."
573,That possibility is all the more real because Ersin has always lived there and has therefore grown up in the cultural and linguistic environment of his country.
574," Having regard to all these considerations,"
575,"while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, "
576,"True, as the Court recognised in the Berrehab judgment, subsequent events may break such a family life relationship, but only exceptional circumstances can warrant the conclusion that the tie between a parent and his or her child is severed."
577,"The mere fact that, at the relevant date, the applicant had not seen his then seven-year-old son for almost seven years is not sufficient to produce this negative effect."
578,"""According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’"", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned."
579,"Rightly so, for, generally speaking, it may be assumed that after a period of between three and five years immigrants become rooted in the country of settlement."
580,By then they have formed new social ties there and have definitively begun to adapt themselves to their new homeland.
581," In assessing the humaneness of the choice with which the Swiss authorities confronted the applicant and his wife this element, the fact that they have become integrated in their new homeland - an element which, incidentally, is closely connected with their private life - is of far more importance than the formal status of their permit."
582,"The first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind."
583,"The second is that the applicant’s wife is dependent on medical care which she can certainly get in Switzerland, whilst it is in debate to what extent, if at all, she will be able to get it in Turkey."
584,"The third is that the mere fact that the Turkish authorities did not immediately arrest the applicant when he entered the country as a visitor does not imply that he would not get into trouble if he tried to settle there again on a permanent basis."
585,"The fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990."
586,"Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey."
587,On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin. 
588,"Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife,"
589,"it follows from the aforementioned Berrehab judgment (p. 14, para. 21) that there is ipso facto such a relationship (see also the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 54)."
590,"The present case concerns not only family life but also immigration, and the extent of a State’s obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest."
591,"As a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory (see, among other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67)."
592,"Moreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.  "
593,"In order to establish the scope of the State’s obligations, the facts of the case must be considered (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 32, para. 88). "
594,since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.
595,"The Court now holds that the applicable principles are similar, adding that in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community"
596," For present purposes it may, therefore, be assumed that it makes no material difference whether a positive or a negative obligation is at stake. "
597,"The present doctrine notably implies that the distinction between the two types of obligation has no bearing on either the burden of proof or the standards for assessing whether a fair balance has been struck."
598,"(see, inter alia: the above-mentioned Keegan judgment, loc. cit. (paragraph 7 above); the above-mentioned Hokkanen judgment, p. 20, para. 55; and the Stjerna v. Finland judgment of 25 November 1994, Series A no. 299-B, p. 61, para. 39)."
599,"The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes."
600,"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive."
601,"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 21 and 23 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose."
602,"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 23 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"")."
603,"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence"
604,"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76)."
605,This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.
606," The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness."
607,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).
608,"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 32 above)."
609,"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults."
610," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
611,It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.
612,"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. "
613,"However an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public."
614,"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older."
615,"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention."
616,"The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment."
617,"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47)."
618,"This was, albeit in a different context, the view expressed by the Divisional Court in its judgment of 20 April 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh - see paragraph 24 above)."
619,"The decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time."
620,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 76)."
621,"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence."
622,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67)."
623,"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing"
624,"The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness,"
625,"Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses."
626, It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.
627,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about."
628,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention."
629,"it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion."
630,"It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above)."
631,"the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259)."
632,The Court observes that not every sexual activity carried out behind closed doors necessarily falls within the scope of Article 8 (art. 8).
633,"In the present case, the applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic activities for purposes of sexual gratification."
634,"There can be no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an intimate aspect of private life (see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52)."
635,"However, a considerable number of people were involved in the activities in question which included, inter alia, the recruitment of new ""members"", the provision of several specially equipped ""chambers"", and the shooting of many videotapes which were distributed among the ""members"" (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above)."
636,"It may thus be open to question whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely within the notion of ""private life"" in the particular circumstances of the case."
637,"However, since this point has not been disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case."
638,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52)."
639,"This submission was contested by the Government and by a majority of the Commission."
640," In support of their submission, the applicants alleged that all those involved in the sado-masochistic encounters were willing adult participants; that participation in the acts complained of was carefully restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities; that the acts were not witnessed by the public at large and that there was no danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed; that no serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no infection had been caused to the wounds, and that no medical treatment had been required."
641,"Furthermore, no complaint was ever made to the police - who learnt about the applicants’ activities by chance (see paragraph 8 above)."
642," In fact, in the present case, some of these acts could well be compared to ""genital torture"" and a Contracting State could not be said to have an obligation to tolerate acts of torture because they are committed in the context of a consenting sexual relationship."
643,"The State was moreover entitled to prohibit activities because of their potential danger."
644,"In this respect, acts of torture - such as those in issue in the present case - may be banned also on the ground that they undermine the respect which human beings should confer upon each other."
645,"In any event, the whole issue of the role of consent in the criminal law is of great complexity and the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options."
646,"Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options.
41.   The Commission noted that the injuries that were or could be caused by the applicants’ activities were of a significant nature and degree, and that the conduct in question was, on any view, of an extreme character."
647,The scope of this margin of appreciation is not identical in each case but will vary according to the context.
648,"Relevant factors include the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities concerned "
649,"(see the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1291-92, para. 74)."
650,"This is so whether the activities in question occur in the course of sexual conduct or otherwise."
651," The determination of the level of harm that should be tolerated by the law in situations where the victim consents is in the first instance a matter for the State concerned since what is at stake is related, on the one hand, to public health considerations and to the general deterrent effect of the criminal law, and, on the other, to the personal autonomy of the individual."
652,"(see the Dudgeon judgment cited above, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259)."
653,that the applicants’ sado-masochistic activities involved a significant degree of injury or wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or transient.
654,"In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the State authorities were entitled to have regard not only to the actual seriousness of the harm caused - which as noted above was considered to be significant - but also, as stated by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (see paragraph 21 above), to the potential for harm inherent in the acts in question."
655,"In this respect it is recalled that the activities were considered by Lord Templeman to be ""unpredictably dangerous"" (see paragraph 20 above)."
656,The Court finds no evidence in support of the applicants’ allegations in either the conduct of the proceedings against them or the judgment of the House of Lords.
657,"In this respect it recalls the remark of the trial judge when passing sentence that ""the unlawful conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by them"" (see paragraph 11 above)."
658,"Moreover, it is clear from the judgment of the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above)."
659,"In any event, like the Court of Appeal, the Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present case (see paragraph 30 above)."
660,The Court notes that the charges of assault were numerous and referred to illegal activities which had taken place over more than ten years.
661,"However, only a few charges were selected for inclusion in the prosecution case."
662," The concept of private life cannot be stretched indefinitely."
663,Not every aspect of private life automatically qualifies for protection under the Convention.
664,The fact that the behaviour concerned takes place on private premises does not suffice to ensure complete immunity and impunity.
665,Not everything that happens behind closed doors is necessarily acceptable.
666,"It is already the case in criminal law that the ""rape"" of a spouse where there is doubt whether consent was given may lead to prosecution."
667,Other types of behaviour may give rise to civil proceedings (internal telephone tapping for example).
668,"Sexual acts and abuse, even when not criminal, give rise to liability."
669,"The case could have been looked at differently, both in domestic law and subsequently under the Convention."
670,"Can one consider that adolescents taking part in sado-masochistic activities have given their free and informed consent where their elders have used various means of enticement, including financial reward?"
671,"In domestic law, sado-masochistic activities could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence without that being contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights."
672,It seems to me that the wording used by the Court in paragraph 42 is too vague.
673,"It seemed to me necessary to expand paragraph 43 by noting ""to regulate and punish practices of sexual abuse that are demeaning even if they do not involve the infliction of physical harm""."
674,"The dangers of unrestrained permissiveness, which can lead to debauchery, paedophilia (see paragraph 11 of the judgment) or the torture of others, were highlighted at the Stockholm World Conference."
675,"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment"
676,"(see Olivier de Schutter’s commentary on that judgment in Revue trimestrielle des droits de l’homme, Brussels, 1997, pp. 64-93)."
677,"The Court considers that one of the roles which the State is unquestionably entitled to undertake is to seek to regulate, through the operation of the criminal law, activities which involve the infliction of physical harm."
678,"Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
679,"In these circumstances, bearing in mind the degree of organisation involved in the offences, the measures taken against the applicants cannot be regarded as disproportionate."
680,"This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present (see the Dudgeon judgment cited above,"
681,"Nor does the Court accept the applicants’ submission that no prosecution should have been brought against them since their injuries were not severe and since no medical treatment had been required."
682,The applicants have further submitted that they were singled out partly because of the authorities’ bias against homosexuals
683,It is evident from the facts established by the national courts
684,"the ""protection of the reputation or rights of others""."
685,"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention""."
686,"The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that ""[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred"" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression."
687,"In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968)."
688,"The applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views."
689,"The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia."
690,"The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure."
691,"The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths. "
692,"Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the ""reputation or rights of others""."
693,since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable.
694,The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal.
695,Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.
696,"Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme."
697,It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value.
698,"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,"
699,"since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining."
700,The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences
701,"it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated."
702,"It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time."
703,"Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965."
704,"(see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57)."
705,"Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
706, The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements.
707,He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions. 
708,"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above)."
709,"The Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2)."
710,"On the other hand, as to the contents of the Greenjackets item, it should be noted that the TV presenter’s introduction started by a reference to recent public discussion and press comments on racism in Denmark, thus inviting the viewer to see the programme in that context."
711,"He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background."
712,There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim.
713,"Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas."
714,"On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern."
715,The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).
716,"However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it."
717," Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above)."
718,"The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed."
719,"Both the TV presenter’s introduction and the applicant’s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of ""a group of extremist youths"" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them."
720,The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs.
721,"It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets."
722,"Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race."
723,"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,"
724,"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest."
725,Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.
726,"Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (ibid.)."
727,We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.
728,"A journalist’s good intentions are not enough in such a situation, especially in a case in which he has himself provoked the racist statements."
729,The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination probably does not require the punishment of journalists responsible for a television spot of this kind.
730,"On the other hand, it supports the opinion that the media too can be obliged to take a clear stand in the area of racial discrimination and hatred."
731,"The threat of racial discrimination and persecution is certainly serious in our society, and the Court has rightly emphasised the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations (paragraph 30 of the judgment)."
732,"The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant."
733,"The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court."
734,the applicant’s conviction being based on Articles 266 (b) and 23 (1) of the Penal Code.
735,"In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention."
736,"The Government’s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above)."
737,"In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention."
738,It recalls both its own findings and those of the Commission as to the general inadequacy and unreliability of custody records
739,"(see İrfan Bilgin v. Turkey, no. 25659/94, § 130, ECHR 2001 VIII, Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 105, ECHR 1999-IV, and Aydın v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI, p. 1941, § 172)."
740,"On the other hand, the Court observes that the testimonies of Abdurrazak1, Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy, who were detained at the Rapid Intervention Force, were balanced, detailed and consistent with each other."
741,"Concluding that such records cannot in general be relied upon to prove that a person was not taken into custody, the Court considers that the fact that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy's name was not in the custody record at the Diyarbakır Security Directorate does not itself prove that he was not in custody."
742,"It therefore accepts the evidence of the four witnesses who stated that they had seen Mehmet Şah when they were themselves being held on the same premises."
743," Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out the circumstances when deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted."
744,"Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe."
745,The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective
746,"In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. "
747,Detained persons are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.
748,"The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (Orhan, cited above, § 326)."
749,"Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention."
750,"(see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII, Çakıcı, cited above, § 85, Ertak v. Turkey, no. 20764/92, § 32, ECHR 2000-V, Timurtaş v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, § 82, ECHR 2000-VI, and Orhan, cited above, § 327)."
751,"(see, amongst other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 87, ECHR 1999-V)."
752,"(McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, §§ 146-147)."
753,"The Court has accepted above (paragraph 65) that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 and died on 23 November 1993 while he was under the control of the security authorities of the respondent state."
754,The Court draws very strong inferences from the lack of any documentary evidence indicating that Mehmet Şah was taken into custody.
755,It has held in its earlier judgments that an unacknowledged detention would be life-threatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993
756,"(see Taş v. Turkey, no. 24396/94, § 66, 14 November 2000, Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 146, 27 February 2001, and Timurtaş, cited above, § 85)."
757," Furthermore, as explained below (see paragraph 79), the autopsy examination, which had critical importance in determining the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, was defective in fundamental aspects."
758,"In this respect, the Court is further struck by the refusal of the domestic authorities to deliver Mehmet Şah's body to his family, who intended to request a detailed autopsy."
759,The Court therefore concludes that it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mehmet Şah died during a clash. 
760,"The authorities have thus failed to establish the real circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, who was under their custody."
761,"  In view of the above, the Court concludes that Mehmet Şah was deprived of his life in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent State."
762,There is nothing to suggest that this was necessary for any of the reasons set out in the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Convention.
763,"The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility."
764,What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.
765,"However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention."
766,"They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII)."
767,"The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (Oğur, cited above, § 88)."
768,"This is not an obligation of result, but of means. "
769,"The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye-witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 109, ECHR 1999 IV)."
770," Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor was defective in a number of fundamental aspects."
771,"The Court is struck by the heavy reliance placed by the public prosecutor, who investigated the death of Mehmet Şah, on the conclusion of the incident report dated 23 November 1993. "
772,According to this incident report an intense clash had taken place which lasted for twenty minutes.
773,"Furthermore, according to the ballistic report 251 bullet cases had been recovered from the place of the incident."
774,However it does not appear from the file whether the public prosecutor compared the facts as stated in the incident report with the photographs of the hut taken after the incident.
775,The public prosecutor appears to have excluded the possibility that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah could have been different than those stated in the incident report.
776,"In this respect, it should also be recalled that the applicants had brought to the public prosecutor's attention the possibility that Mehmet Şah could have been killed under torture. "
777,"Without taking statements from the family members of the deceased who were also arrested that day or the police officers who were involved in the clash, the public prosecutor concluded that Mehmet Şah had died during a clash."
778, It further appears from the autopsy report that Mehmet Şah was shot from behind by a bullet which entered from the upper part of his shoulder and exited from below his chest.
779,It is striking that the public prosecutor did not seek any further explanation as to how a person involved in an intense clash could be shot from behind and most probably by a person who was standing above him.
780,The Court also observes in this context that the autopsy report lacked valuable and important information which would clarify the circumstance surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah.
781,"The absence of any indication about the approximate positions of the person who fired and the victim and the distance between them at the moment of the shot as well as the size of the bullet entry and exit wounds constitute important deficiencies."
782," In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention."
783,The Court refers to its finding above where it has established that Mehmet Şah had died while he was under the control of the domestic authorities (see paragraph 65).
784,"However contrary to the applicants' allegations of torture, it observes from the photographs and the autopsy report that there were no marks or injuries on the body of Mehmet Şah which were consistent with the allegations of torture."
785,It notes that the applicants' allegations of torture are solely based on the assumption that some of the persons who were detained in the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters had heard the cries of Mehmet Şah.
786,"On the basis of the material in its possession and noting that the allegation of ill-treatment is not corroborated by any other evidence, the Court notes that the applicants' complaints are based on hypothesis and speculation rather than on reliable evidence."
787,"In these circumstances, and having regard to its conclusion under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it appropriate to draw inferences proposed by the applicants as to whether torture or ill-treatment occurred (see, in this respect, Tanlı, cited above, § 159)."
788," As regards the applicants' submission concerning the effects of the events on themselves, the Court has no doubt of the profound suffering caused by the death of Mehmet Şah."
789,"It finds no basis however for finding a violation of Article 3 in this context."
790," In so far as the applicants complain about the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy, the Court recalls in the first place that the term victim in Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or the omission which is at issue (see Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p.30, § 66)."
791,The Court observes that the two applicants are not personally concerned by the detention of these four persons. 
792,"Furthermore, they cannot substantiate the reason why these persons have themselves refrained from lodging applications with the Court."
793,The Court is therefore satisfied that there were reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants had been involved in an offence.
794,It has examined these elements and has not disclosed any manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary conclusions drawn by the competent authorities from them.
795,"It thus sees no reason to doubt that the elements of which the authorities disposed were sufficient to believe, at that time, that the applicants had been involved in an offence."
796,The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).
797,"Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26775/95, § 155, ECHR 2000-IV)."
798,"What may be regarded as reasonable will however depend on all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, § 32)."
799,The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established.
800,"It is precisely the purpose of the investigation that the reality and nature of the offences laid against the accused should definitely be proved (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300 A, p. 27, § 55)."
801,"Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 does not even presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicant was in custody (see Erdagöz v. Turkey, judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2314, § 51)."
802," In the instant case the Court observes that the applicants were taken into custody, on suspicion of aiding and abetting the PKK and for being involved in the events which resulted in the killing of a police officer and the wounding of another."
803," Concerning the police custody of the first applicant, the Court recalls that the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3."
804,"No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58)."
805,"The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as “prompt” for these purposes."
806,"As to the length of the police custody of the second applicant, the Court observes that he was held in police custody for eleven days from 22 November to 3 December 1993."
807,"It recalls that in the Brogan and Others case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to the time laid down by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism"
808,"(see Brogan and Others, cited above, p. 33, § 62)."
809," Even though the investigation of terrorist offences, as supposed in this case, presents the authorities with special problems, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain the second applicant for eleven days without judicial intervention."
810," Concerning the first applicant, the Court recalls its finding under Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 103) that he was released before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible"
811," Concerning the second applicant, the Court notes that a judge did not intervene until the end of his police custody, that is to say eleven days after his arrest."
812,"Having regard to the conclusion it reached with regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 106), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily”"
813,"(see Sakık and Others, cited above, § 53)."
814," In respect of the first applicant, the Court reiterates that this provision guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention"
815,"(see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 755, § 50)."
816,"As regards the second applicant who was held in custody for eleven days, the Court notes that the domestic legislation which was in force at the time of the events permitted police custody up to fifteen days without being brought before a judge. "
817,"Accordingly, a compensation request for police custody which lasted for eleven days would not succeed before the domestic courts."
818," As the Court has held many times, Article 13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. "
819,"The applicants' complaints in this regard are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and Kaya, cited above, § 107)."
820,The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy.
821,"For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 78-80), no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which may be broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Articles 2 and 3 (Kaya, cited above, pp. 330-331, § 107, Salman, cited above, § 123, and Nuray Şen v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, § 193, 30 March 2004)."
822," The Court recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of the individual petition instituted by former Article 25 (now replaced by Article 34) that applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Convention organs without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see Şarli v. Turkey, no. 24490/94, § 84, 22 May 2001)."
823,"In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a convention remedy."
824,"Turning to the facts of the instant case, the Court observes that it is accepted by the parties that the applicant was indeed interviewed by the public prosecutor on 6 June 1995 as alleged upon the instructions of the Ministry of Justice International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate concerning his application with the Commission (see paragraphs 39 and 56)."
825," The Court therefore finds that the applicant was subjected to indirect and improper pressure to make statements in respect of his application to the Commission which interfered with the free exercise of his right of individual petition guaranteed under Article 25."
826,"The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision."
827,The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.
828,"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy, cited above, § 95, Aydın, cited above, § 103, and Kaya, cited above, § 89)."
829,The nature of the rights safeguarded under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13.
830,"Where there is an arguable claim that an individual has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment, or deprived of his or her life, by agents of the State, Article 13 requires, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the treatment in question or the deprivation of life, including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (Salman, cited above, § 121)."
831,"  On the basis of the evidence adduced in the present case, the Court has found that the Government are responsible under Article 2 of the Convention for the death of Mehmet Şah while he was under custody."
832," The applicants complained that there had been a serious interference with the exercise of their right of individual petition, in breach of Article 25 of the Convention (now replaced by Article 34), which provides as follows:"
833,"“The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.”"
834,The applicants submitted that on 6 June 1995 the first applicant was taken before the public prosecutor for interrogation concerning his application with the Commission.
835,He was questioned about his individual application and was asked whether the signatures on the letter of authority and his statement to the Human Rights Association belonged to him.
836,"The first applicant had to sign his statement under pressure and stated that he would retract his application."
837," In Mr Palaoro's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a ""criminal charge"".  "
838," Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
839,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  
840,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
841,"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 18 above). "
842,"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
843,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  "
844,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison. "
845,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
846,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions. "
847,"It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.  "
848,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
849,"  Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
850,"Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  "
851,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
852,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here. "
853,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.  "
854,"They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case. "
855,"The Court notes that Mr Palaoro based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
856,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
857,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied. "
858,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
859,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
860,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
861,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
862,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  "
863,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
864,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  "
865,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
866,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
867,  The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
868," It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
869,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
870,"It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  "
871,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
872," It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"". "
873,"(see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47)."
874, It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred
875,"(see, for instance, the Ahmet Sadik v. Greece judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1652, para. 26)."
876,"In these circumstances, the Commission did not find it necessary to examine whether the detention was ""lawful"" under domestic law."
877,"The applicant, for his part, stressed that the decisions leading to the charges against him and his being detained on remand had been taken collectively by the government at the time and in a manner which was consistent with the relevant law, including the then Bulgarian Constitution; the allocation of the funds in question had been effected in accordance with the national budget as adopted by the National Assembly and had subsequently been approved by the latter."
878,The measures had been in keeping not only with the policies of the government at the time but also with relevant United Nations resolutions on development assistance. 
879,"They had not benefited any members of the government or any third parties; the funds had been received in their entirety by the addressee countries."
880,The Government maintained before the Commission that the applicant’s detention had been effected on the grounds of suspicion of his having committed a crime and had been in conformity with Bulgarian law.
881,"Although it was true that the allocation of development aid had not as such constituted a criminal offence, the charges in question had been brought because the transfers of funds had, under the cover of development assistance, involved improper ""deals"" causing damage to Bulgaria’s economic interests."
882,"The Government were, however, not in a position to provide any details of such ""deals"" as it would adversely affect the confidentiality of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant and eight other former government members."
883,"Before the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above)."
884," The Prosecutor-General’s submission on the applicant’s complaints included the following observations."
885,It was a key element of the offence of misappropriation under Bulgarian law that the offender had dealt with someone else’s property as though it had been his or her own and had thereby infringed the owner’s interests; it was not decisive whether he or she had sought to obtain an advantage for himself or herself or for a third party (see paragraph 26 above).
886,"Furthermore, members of a body could by reason of their joint decisions and actions be found guilty if they had thereby knowingly committed acts which amounted to an offence."
887,"In the present case, since the collective decisions concerned had caused economic loss, criminal proceedings had been instituted against each member of the body which had taken those decisions (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above)."
888,"The prosecutor had believed that the funds concerned had been spent in a manner which was unlawful since there was no information as to whether they had appeared in the budget as an expenditure."
889,"Admittedly, the Prosecutor-General had not been in a position at the time to ascertain whether there was criminal intent."
890,"He had considered, having regard to the circumstances and complexity of the case, that this could only be determined in the course of the preliminary investigations."
891,"Although not expressly stated in the order to detain the applicant on remand, the decision had been taken in view of who the applicant was and the gravity of the offence committed (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above)."
892,The Supreme Court too had laid stress on the applicant’s status as a member of the National Assembly (see paragraph 13 above).
893,The extremely wide powers which he had enjoyed by virtue of his position had given him greater opportunities to abscond or commit further offences than he would have had otherwise.
894,"Furthermore, his position in society, his numerous contacts abroad and his repeated requests that the authorities return his passport, were all considerations which went to justify placing him in pre-trial detention."
895,"In all cases before the Court, what is in issue is the international responsibility of the State"
896,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Foti and Others v. Italy judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 21, para. 63)."
897,"(see, for instance, the Ciulla v. Italy judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 148, p. 18, para. 41)."
898, Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) contains an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty which must be interpreted strictly
899,"The Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was ""lawful"" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected ""in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law""."
900,"(see, for instance, the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54; and the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 752-53, para. 40)."
901,"Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that it is undisputed that the applicant had, as a member of the Bulgarian Government, taken part in the decisions - granting funds in assistance and loans to certain developing countries - which had given rise to the charges against him."
902," However, none of the provisions of the Criminal Code relied on to justify the detention - Articles 201 to 203, 219 and 282 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) - specified or even implied that anyone could incur criminal liability by taking part in collective decisions of this nature."
903,"Moreover, no evidence has been adduced to show that such decisions were unlawful, that is to say contrary to Bulgaria’s Constitution or legislation, or more specifically that the decisions were taken in excess of powers or were contrary to the law on the national budget."
904,"In the light of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the conduct for which the applicant was prosecuted constituted a criminal offence under Bulgarian law at the relevant time."
905," What is more, the public prosecutor’s order of detention of 9 July 1992 and the Supreme Court’s decision of 13 July upholding the order referred to Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 13 and 25 above)."
906,"As appears from the case-law supplied to the Court, a constituent element of the offence of misappropriation under Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code was that the offender had sought to obtain for himself or herself or for a third party an advantage (see paragraph 26 above)."
907,"The order of 9 July in addition referred to Article 282 which specifically makes it an offence for a public servant to abuse his or her power in order to obtain such advantage (see paragraphs 9 and 28 above)."
908,"However, the Court has not been provided with any fact or information capable of showing that the applicant was at the time reasonably suspected of having sought to obtain for himself or a third party an advantage from his participation in the allocation of funds in question"
909," In this connection it is to be noted that the Government’s submission that there had been certain ""deals"" was found by the Commission to be unsubstantiated and was not reiterated before the Court."
910,"Indeed, it was not contended before the Convention institutions that the funds had not been received by the States concerned."
911,"(see, for instance, the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 25, para. 51)."
912," In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty during the period under consideration was ""lawful detention"" effected ""on reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence""."
913," The applicant alleged that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), which, in so far as relevant, reads:
""Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
...
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;"
914,"The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, was of the opinion that the facts which had been invoked against him at the time of his arrest and during his continued detention (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 13 above) could not, in the eyes of an objective observer, be construed as misappropriation of funds or as a breach of official duties aimed at facilitating the commission of such an offence."
915,"(see, for instance, the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54; and the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 752-53, para. 40)."
916,"The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility"
917,"(see, inter alia, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, para. 29)."
918,"In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint."
919,"(see paragraph 26 above), which the Court examined in its Wynne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 July 1994 (Series A no. 294-A),"
920,in that the former is not solely based on the gravity of the offence but takes into account the age of the offender.
921,"The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes."
922,"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive."
923,"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 27 and 29 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose."
924,"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 29 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"")."
925,"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence."
926,"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76)."
927,This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.
928," The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness."
929,This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).
930,"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above)."
931,"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults."
932," It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion."
933,"It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above)."
934,"On the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word ""life"" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence."
935," Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
936,It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.
937,"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. "
938,"However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public."
939,"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older."
940,"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention."
941,  The Commission found that the Parole Board’s lack of decision-making power
942,"As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
943,"Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government."
944,"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)."
945,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67)."
946," The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing"
947," The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses."
948, It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.
949,"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about."
950,"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention."
951,"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994."
952," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
953," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
954," For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax."
955,"The Government found the sum claimed excessive."
956,"in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring before a court the case of his continueddetention or of his re-detention following the revocationof his licence;"
957," He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000."
958,"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994."
959,"The Government found the sum claimed excessive."
960," For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax."
961, There had in their contention not been any danger for them or their families.
962,"Moreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge."
963,"It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be."
964,"In addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers. "
965,"They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place."
966,"The anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there."
967,Not all the questions asked by the defence had been answered.
968,"Finally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based ""to a decisive extent"" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses."
969,"The only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal positively identifying the applicants had been that given by anonymous police officers."
970,"This was borne out by the fact that Mr Engelen, the one named witness who in the earlier stages of the proceedings had made statements incriminating one of the applicants, had not been granted anonymity and it had not been suggested that he had at any time been threatened."
971,"   In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State. "
972,"Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim."
973,They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.
974,"In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court."
975,"On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49)."
976,"Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary."
977,"If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied."
978,"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine)."
979,"It has not been explained to the Court’s satisfaction why it was necessary to resort to such extreme limitations on the right of the accused to have the evidence against them given in their presence, or why less far-reaching measures were not considered."
980," In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded."
981,All communication was via a sound link.
982,"It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact."
983,Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families.
984,It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf.
985,Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed
986,"In this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened."
987," It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous."
988,However these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability.
989,"It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures."
990," Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers."
991,"That being so the conviction of the applicants was based ""to a decisive extent"" on these anonymous statements."
992,"In the Court’s view, the present case falls to be distinguished from that of Doorson: in the latter case it was decided on the basis of information contained in the case file itself that the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 - who were both civilians, and who knew the accused personally - had sufficient reason to believe that he might resort to violence, and they were heard in the presence of counsel (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 454-55, para. 25, pp. 455-56, para. 28, and pp. 470-71, paras. 71 and 73)."
993,"In addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76)."
994,This is a borderline case.
995,"On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166)."
996,"On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals."
997,"Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken."
998,"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d))."
999,"Even though the Court is not bound by precedent, legal certainty and legal equality require that the Court’s case-law be both consistent and transparent as well as reasonably predictable in so far as the facts of the case are comparable to those of earlier cases."
1000,"Since ""the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court."
1001,The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).
1002,"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there)."
1003,The Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given.
1004,"However, had it been in force, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal would have been in conformity with the rules thereby introduced."
1005,"It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness."
1006,The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).
1007,"However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure."
1008,"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention. "
1009,"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own."
1010,"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law."
1011,"Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case."
1012,"It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room."
1013,I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all.
1014,"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47)."
1015," In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:"
1016," The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation."
1017,The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own.
1018,"In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v. Austria judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, p. 10, para. 27), Lüdi (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49), and Saïdi (Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, para. 44)."
1019,"The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73)."
1020,The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge.
1021,"The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge."
1022,"In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial. "
1023,"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43)."
1024,"The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49)."
1025," The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29)."
1026,The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment.
1027,Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable.
1028,Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses.
1029,"It is necessary not only to recognise the discretion of the competent domestic court in maintaining conformity with the exigencies of the proper administration of justice, but also to balance the interests of the defence under Article 6 (art. 6) against the interests of witnesses protected by other substantive provisions of the Convention (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 70). "
1030,"Although in the Lüdi judgment (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49) the Court considered the interest of the police authorities in preserving the anonymity of their agents ""legitimate"", greater weight should be given in this case, as was done by the Court of Appeal, to the agents’ interest in the protection of their lives and safety and those of their families (Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention) (art. 2, art. 3, art. 5, art. 8)."
1031,"The defence were given ample opportunity to hear and question the witnesses, and to comment on the recording of their answers, and in fact made extensive use of that opportunity; the technical deficiencies complained of were inconvenient and might perhaps have been avoided, but, given especially the extensive time reserved for the hearings and the detailed way in which the statements were recorded, these deficiencies were not such as to hamper the defence to a significant extent."
1032,"The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so."
1033,"Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal."
1034,The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses.
1035,"Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation."
1036,"In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them""."
1037,"In the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of ""decisive extent"" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34)."
1038," A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable."
1039,"From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court."
1040,"The fact that police officers were fired at in pursuit does not necessarily mean that at a later stage, during or after the trial, their lives and safety and/or those of their families were in danger."
1041,"However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied)."
1042,"In the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant."
1043,In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers.
1044,"Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons."
1045,"The ""general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities"" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection."
1046, It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations.
1047,"Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence."
1048,The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise.
1049,"However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be ""decisive"" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment)."
1050,"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned."
1051," implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve "
1052,"The applicants argued that if the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal had not relied on the statements of the anonymous police officers, there"
1053,would have been no case against them and they would have been acquitted.
1054,"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine)."
1055,"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification. It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of "
1056,Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.
1057,"The Government and the Commission both considered that there had been no violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d)."
1058," In this regard, the applicant mainly focuses on internal
structural and organisational matters."
1059,"He refers, inter alia, to the
status, roles and duties of the Convening Officer, the Judge Advocate
and the Judge Advocate General's office."
1060,"The applicant also refers to
the relationship of the members of the court-martial, the Convening
Officer and the Reviewing Authorities to the prosecuting authority."
1061,"He
points to the lack of civilian judicial members of the court-martial,
the absence of guarantees against outside pressures and the ad hoc
nature of the appointment of the members of the court-martial."
1062,"The Government
point out, inter alia, that the members of the court-martial take an
oath of independence and impartiality,"
1063,"that none of those members is
subject to instruction by a higher authority,"
1064,"that the Convening
Officer is not the prosecuting authority,"
1065,"that the Judge Advocate and
the advisers in the Judge Advocate General's office are civilians,
experienced members of the legal profession and totally independent of
the armed forces, and that an individual member of a court-martial
cannot be removed by a superior officer once appointed.
"
1066," The Government also argue that the Judge Advocate must satisfy
himself that none of the members of the court-martial knows the accused
or has heard anything about the charges."
1067,"In the present case the
applicant did not object to the constitution of the court-martial and
in any event, according to the Government, it does not follow from the
fact that the members of the court-martial were all subordinate in rank
to the Convening Officer (having no direct prior relationship with that
Officer) that they lacked independence or impartiality.
"
1068,"He argues that, inter alia, these factors meant that he was neither
able to establish upon what basis the relevant bodies made their
decisions nor, therefore, effectively able to participate in any of the
post-hearing reviews and the judicial review proceedings.
"
1069,"The applicant also points, in this respect, to an inequality of
arms between the prosecution and the defence due to the Convening
Officer's effective control of the court-martial hearing through the
prosecuting officer, and to the conduct of the prosecuting officer, the
Judge Advocate and the Convening Officer (the latter of whom allegedly
failed to ensure the attendance of a vital witness) in respect of that
hearing."
1070,"These factors, the applicant submits, also contributed to the
overall unfairness of the proceedings against him."
1071,"He also takes issue
with the limited sentencing regime available and the reasonableness of
the decisions reached in his case."
1072," In this respect the applicant points mainly to the lack of
reasons for the decisions of the court-martial, the Confirming Officer
and the Reviewing Authorities, the privacy surrounding the advice given
by the Judge Advocate and the Judge Advocate General's office, together
with the administrative and private nature of the post-hearing reviews."
1073,"The second Reviewing Authority did not
seek any such advice, and therefore a person without any legal
qualifications or advice made the final decision on the applicant's
petition against sentence."
1074,"The Government also submit that, in light of the importance of
discipline in the armed forces and in view of the seriousness of the
charges, the reasons for the sentence were obvious."
1075," In addition, the Government dispute that the Convening Officer
controlled the proceedings through the prosecuting officer, and point
out that the applicant was represented by an experienced lawyer."
1076,"The
Government also refer to the fact that the conduct of the Judge
Advocate was considered and found acceptable by the Divisional Court,
and submit that the prosecuting officer did all that was possible to
ensure the attendance of the relevant witness, including issuing a
witness summons."
1077,"The applicant has, according to the Government, no
right to an appeal under the Convention and, in any event, the post-
hearing reviews are not, according to the Government, designed to be
full appeals, but rather further pleas in mitigation."
1078," In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that
the question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or
military authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though
by agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain
matters to the civilian authorities."
1079,"A wider sentencing regime is not
possible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the
fact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving
member of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties."
1080,"The
Government further submit that the decision of the court-martial was
reasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army
life, the context in which the offences were committed and the
seriousness of the charges."
1081,The essence of the case concerns the criticisms made in the Inspectors' report about the first three applicants and the effects of the report upon their honour and reputation.
1082,Even though they own the fourth applicant company no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward.
1083,In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.
1084,"The extensive publicity
 
after the report's publication was ephemeral."
1085,"Whilst it is true that
an action in defamation against these public officials would probably
have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely
reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic
law, rather than the right of access to court for determining the
applicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the
Convention."
1086,"The Government have contended that the applicants could
have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly
proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for
them, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by
them during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in
respect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report."
1087,"The
Government have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury

trial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore

had to withdrew the defamation proceedings against The Observer."
1088,They have contended that the report could not be used as evidence in those proceedings.
1089,"The Government emphasised that the decision of the Secretary of State to publish the report was not a decision directed against the applicants; it was a decision taken in the general public interest, including that of freedom of expression and information, having regard to the overall content of the report."
1090,The Commission considers that this part of the application raises a serious question of fact and law which is of such complexity that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits.
1091,"Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, cited above, guarantees a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges. "
1092,"Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) provides that anyone ""charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law""."
1093,"The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation."
1094,"They had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth

applicant's affairs, and, in particular the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985."
1095,Before the Inspectors' report was published it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants.
1096,The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants. 
1097,"They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence."
1098,"The Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution"
1099,"(cf. the Court's aforementioned Deweer judgment of 27 February 1990, p. 24, para. 46, and the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, p. 15, para. 30)."
1100,"However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been ""charged"" any longer."
1101,The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements. 
1102,"The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs."
1103,"The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation."
1104,"In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras.

1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed."
1105,"Everyone has the right to respect for his private
... life ...

2.	There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."""
1106,"The applicants have submitted, inter alia, that English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case. The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation."
1107,"Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information."
1108,"Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this."
1109,The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all.
1110,"Nor was there any need to protect others' right such as those of Lonrho, by publishing the report in its entirety, as their rights were adequately secured by the ordinary courts."
1111,"The Government have contended, inter alia, that the report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants."
1112,They stated that the applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage.
1113,The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen. 
1114,"The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy (cf. the Inspectors' report paras. 16.2.5

and 16.6.2, pp. 5-6 above)."
1115,"Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above)"
1116,"States enjoy a margin of appreciation in their decision whether to publish reports of the present kind, provided that the decision is not taken arbitrarily or with malice towards the particular individuals involved. "
1117,"The question is one of proportionality or balance between the public and the individual interests.
"
1118,The Commission finds that no elements of arbitrariness are disclosed in the present case.
1119,"Although it might be fair to say that no investigation into the applicants' affairs would have been started if Lonrho had not launched its campaign against them, the actual investigation by the Inspectors and their report indicate no malice or unreasonableness."
1120,"As a whole the report may be said to be balanced and thorough; it is not a one-sided condemnation of the applicants and

gives them credit where credit is due for their business activities."
1121,"The investigation of certain aspects of their private lives was necessary in view of their claims about their personal backgrounds, which they themselves had vaunted through the media, and as a result of which they had enjoyed a good business reputation for quite some time; hence their success in the HOF takeover bid."
1122,"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to

the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
1123,"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention."
1124,The applicants have alleged that the publication of the report constituted a measure of control of the use of their property.
1125,"It seriously damaged their reputation and financial standing and, thereby, harmed their economic interests in the business of HOF. "
1126,Restrictions were put on their management of Harrods Bank.
1127,The restrictions placed on Harrods Bank were made by the Bank of England and were not caused by the publication of the report.
1128,"If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the

ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions."
1129,No evidence of any significant economic prejudice has been submitted to it.
1130,"Insofar as certain management restrictions were placed on Harrods Bank by the Bank of England one month after publication of the report, the Commission notes that the applicants had a right of appeal to an independent tribunal which does not appear to have been tried

(pp. 14-15 above)."
1131,In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case.
1132," Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows:

""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this
Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy
before a national authority notwithstanding that the
violation has been committed by persons acting in an
official capacity."""
1133,Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.
1134,"However, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention."
1135,"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention"
1136,"The Commission has found above that the applicants' claims under Article 6 paras. 1 (criminal) and 2, Article 8 (Art. 6-1, 6-2,

8)	of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
1137,"In the light of the reasons

upon which those findings are based, the Commission also considers that the facts of the present case fail to disclose an ""arguable claim"" of

a violation of these provisions."
1138,"To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention."
1139,"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention"
1140,"because of the great breadth of the Secretary of State's and the
Inspectors' discretionary powers"
1141,"the restrictive scope of judicial
review"
1142," impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary
of State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had
a defence of absolute or qualified privilege."
1143,The applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct.
1144,"However, Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual

is guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6

(Art. 6)"
1145,"(cf. eg. Eur. Court H.R., Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982,

Series A No. 49; Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35; and No. 7986/77, Krause v. Switzerland, Dec. 3.10.78, D.R. 13 p. 73)."
1146," Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the
 
applicants at all stages of the contents of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit. "
1147,Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids.
1148,Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future.
1149,"It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded."
1150,Moreover the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose.
1151,It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF (p. 7 above).
1152,The Commission finds that the publication of the Inspectors' report with certain of its findings constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.
1153,"However, that interference was in accordance with the law, the publication being authorised by section 437 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 1985. "
1154,Investigations into large scale commercial activities of the present kind and the need to ensure honest dealings fall within the notion of protecting the economic well-being of the country.
1155,The interest of the general public in being informed about matters of major public concern can best be served by the publication of the results of Government inquiries.
1156,Further elements of general interest are cited above at pp. 9 and 13.
1157,The needs of democracy justify transparency in such matters.
1158,"""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful
enjoyment of his possessions.	No one shall be deprived of
his possessions except in the public interest and subject
to the conditions provided for by law and by the general
principles of international law.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way
impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems
necessary to control the use of property in accordance with
the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or
other contributions or penalties."""
1159,"Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about

the acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest."
1160,"They add, in this respect, that although the offence for which the applicant was convicted under Section 99 (1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (refusing to take a breath test) was not, as such, in force on the date of the reservation,  the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users and to pay such attention as is required for the maintenance of order, safety and traffic efficiency.
"
1161,The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and direct hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.
1162,"They also point out that the applicant did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court.
"
1163, He agrees that the scope of review by the Constitutional Court and Administrative Court does not comply with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.
1164," In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although that provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the possibility for the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural limitation and not a substantive one."
1165,"They point out that any appeal lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to comprehensive review."
1166,"The applicant in this respect considers that the limitation of the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction by Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution does not meet the requirements of the reservation, even if it applies."
1167,"The Commission finds that the application raises complex issues of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the Convention, the determination of which must be reserved for an examination on the merits.
"
1168,"In particular, they refer to Section 41 (2) 3 (a)-(c) of the
Administrative Court Act under which the Administrative Court must
quash an authority's decision for violation of procedural rules where
in an essential point the authority has found facts in a way which
contradicts the file,  where the facts require complementation in an
essential point, or where procedural provisions have been disregarded
in circumstances where, had they been observed, the authority could
have arrived at a different decision."
1169,"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision
provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds
which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the
ability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with complaints
against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural
limitation and not a substantive one."
1170,"The Government point out that any
complaint lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is
subject to comprehensive review."
1171,"The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and
direct hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6
(Art. 6) of the Convention."
1172,"They also point out that the applicant did
not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the
Administrative Court.
"
1173,"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the applicant considers that the enlarged grounds for
non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint are in any event at
variance with Convention requirements."
1174,"The Commission finds that the applicant, who was convicted for
speeding twice in the course of one journey, but over separate
stretches of road, was convicted not of one but of two separate
offences."
1175,"It follows that he was not tried or punished again ""for an
offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted""."
1176,"According to the applicant, the order has a chilling effect
on the likelihood of sources communicating information to journalists
such as himself, and his right to impart information to the public has
also been impaired thereby."
1177,"   Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention provides:

      ""1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This
      right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive
      and impart information and ideas without interference by
      public authorities and regardless of frontiers..."
1178,"  The applicant contends that the disclosure order breached his
duty of confidentiality to his source and was not ""prescribed by law"","
1179," Further, the
applicant considers that there was no pressing social need for the
restraint,"
1180," The restraint was
also not proportionate to the aim,"
1181,"since  the law permitting such orders is not formulated with sufficient
precision to enable the individual to foresee with reasonable certainty
when it will be applied."
1182,"In particular, he argues that the criterion
of the ""interests of justice"" is insufficiently certain and renders
impossible the task of a journalist in assessing whether or not he can
give a source an undertaking not to reveal his identity."
1183,"since X Ltd. was already protected by the injunction against
publication of confidential information in the press and had made no
use of alternative means of identifying the source."
1184,"since it included the threat to the
applicant of up to two years' imprisonment and has cast a
disproportionate chilling effect on the free flow of information to the
public generally.
"
1185,"refer to domestic case-law as
indicating that  the relevant principle is well-established, accessible
and foreseeable in its application and consequences."
1186,"for the purpose of protecting the
rights of others and for preventing the disclosure of information
received in confidence."
1187,"They submit that Section 10 of the 1981 Act
gives recognition to the high public importance of protecting the free
flow of information to the press and provides a heavy presumption
against ordering disclosure."
1188,"The interest of protecting journalistic
sources cannot however outweigh all others and, they argue, in the
assessment of whether ""the interests of justice"" required disclosure
in this particular case, the domestic courts gave full and reasoned
consideration to all the competing interests."
1189,"The Government contend
that having regard to the margin of appreciation, accorded to
Contracting States, there is no ground on which the Commission in its
supervisory jurisdiction can substitute its own opinion for that of the
courts."
1190,"The Government submit
however that the interference was ""prescribed by law"" within the
meaning of the second paragraph,"
1191," The Government further submit that the interference was
""necessary in a democratic society"""
1192,"The Commission considers that the applicant's complaints under
Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and
law, the determination of which should depend on a full examination of
the merits."
1193,"They were unable to pursue
proceedings in the High Court in Northern Ireland since the
certificates excluded the jurisdiction of the courts."
1194,"They contest that
their claims necessarily raised matters outside the jurisdiction of the
courts in Northern Ireland."
1195,"Further, they were unable to take
proceedings in Gibraltar since they were not eligible for legal aid and
had no other means of pursuing such proceedings."
1196,"The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate
to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can
provide effective and sufficient redress."
1197,"An applicant does not need
to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach."
1198,"The Commission has held that where, for example,
there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention must be applied to reflect the practical
realities of the applicant's position in order to ensure the effective
protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (cf.
No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78, and No. 9118/80, Dec.
9.3.83, D.R. 32 p. 159)."
1199,"Consequently, the Commission finds that the remedy cannot realistically
have been available to the applicants in this case."
1200,"Further, the Commission finds that the applicants' choice of
pursuing proceedings in the courts of Northern Ireland was not
unreasonable or without basis in domestic law."
1201,"The applicants in those
proceedings (in respect of which they were granted legal aid by the
relevant domestic authorities) intended, inter alia, to argue that
liability arose out of the actions of Crown agents based in the United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland."
1202,"The certificates issued by the Secretary
of State were however conclusive of the fact that the alleged liability
did not arise in respect of the Government in the United Kingdom or in
Northern Ireland and effectively put an end to the proceedings."
1203,"They consider
that Article 2 (Art. 2) imposes a duty on States to adopt clear and
detailed legal rules on the use of lethal force, which strictly control
and limit that use."
1204,"They consider that United Kingdom law is vague and
general and therefore is in itself in violation of this provision."
1205," The applicants further submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) should be
interpreted as including a procedural element, namely, the provision
of an effective procedure after a lethal shooting for establishing the
facts."
1206,"They complain that the Inquest was inadequate, inter alia, as
public interest certificates were used to block crucial evidence."
1207,"They
allege that there had been a lack of diligence in seeking out witnesses
and attempts made to intimidate and discredit those who did come
forward."
1208,"They point out that
the jury on consideration of the evidence found that the killings were
lawful."
1209,"They contend that it is implicit from that finding that the
jury considered that there had been no plot to kill the deceased
terrorists, that the soldiers had honestly and reasonably believed that
there was a car bomb which could be detonated by remote control and
that the degree of force used by the soldiers was proportionate to the
aim of protecting the lives of the people of Gibraltar."
1210," As regards the Inquest proceedings, the Government submit that
it provided an exhaustive fact-finding investigation by an independent
body."
1211,"In particular, they highlight the fact that 78 witnesses
(including the S.A.S soldiers and Security Service personnel involved
in the incident) were extensively examined and cross-examined by the
legal representatives of the applicants, that the Inquest was held
within six months of the incident, that the applicants' representatives
made no challenge to the public immunity certificates, and that the
Coroner exercised his discretion to allow certain questions, despite
objection by the Crown on the basis of the certificates."
1212,"The Commission considers that the applicants' complaints under
Article 2 (Art. 2) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and
law, the determination of which should depend on the merits."
1213,"(cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27
February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec.
11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102)."
1214," It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the
existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the
State invoking the rule"
1215," In the present case, the Commission notes that the applicants,
as conceded by the Government, would not have been eligible for legal
aid in Gibraltar."
1216,"The Commission finds that they have insufficient
means to pay for legal representation themselves."
1217,"In this context the
Commission recalls that they were found eligible under the financial
criteria for legal aid in Northern Ireland and before the Commission
itself."
1218,"Having regard, in addition, to the difficulties imposed by the
distance and the difficulty and complexity of the factual and legal
issues which would have been raised in proceedings in Gibraltar, the
applicants could not have proceeded without legal representation."
1219,"They
submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) requires, in addition, that States
exercise strict operational control over the use of lethal force,
including the giving of appropriate training, briefings and
instructions."
1220,"They contend that soldiers are trained to shoot to kill
without warning and that the operation in Gibraltar was neither planned
nor executed in such a way as to minimise the need for the use of
lethal force."
1221,"They point to the fact that the soldiers were apparently
made to believe (wrongly)"
1222,"firstly, that the suspects were armed;"
1223,"secondly, that there was a car bomb in place;"
1224,"thirdly, that the
bomb could be detonated by the suspects by means of a remote control
device."
1225,"They refer to the safeguards
provided in the Order: no inference may be drawn unless the
suspect/accused has been warned in advance of the possible effect;
before any inference is drawn, the prosecution must have established
a prima facie case against the accused; the judge has a discretion
whether to draw an inference and is limited to drawing only such
inferences as may be proper."
1226,"The Order merely allows the trier of fact
to draw such inferences as common sense dictates."
1227,"In the present case,
there was a formidable case against the applicant which called for
evidence from the applicant if there was an innocent explanation for
his conduct."
1228,"The burden of proof remained throughout on the
prosecution."
1229,"As regards the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor
for 48 hours, the Government contend that this delay did not
disadvantage the applicant in the conduct of his defence and"
1230,"Since
the police have similar powers to delay access in England and Wales,"
1231,"The difference in this respect between the position in
England and Wales and that in Northern Ireland, based as it was solely
on the geographical location at which a person was arrested and
detained,"
1232,"Further, the denial
of access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours and the
discriminatory practice of not permitting solicitors to be present at
any stage while a person arrested under prevention of terrorism
provisions is being interviewed,"
1233,"The discriminatory element derives, inter alia, from the
fact that in England and Wales, contrary to the practice in Northern
Ireland, all detained persons, including those detained under
prevention of terrorism legislation, are permitted to have their legal
representative present during the police interviews."
1234,"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious
issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which
should depend on an examination of the merits."
1235,"As regards the refusal of permission to the applicant's solicitor
to be present during his interviews with the police"
1236,"The applicant submits that the 1988 Order, which permits
inferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer police
questions or to give evidence, and the reliance placed upon it by the
trial judge in the instant case,"
1237,"The very strong inferences drawn by the trial judge
in the applicant's case played a crucial role in his conviction."
1238,"It is
submitted that it is a generally recognised principle of international
law that an accused person cannot be required to incriminate himself,
that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention enshrines this principle, and
that the drawing of an incriminating inference from an accused's
failure to give evidence infringes his right to a fair trial.
"
1239,"The applicant also submits that the drawing of an incriminating
inference from the failure of an accused person to give evidence has
the effect of placing the burden of proof on an accused and is
manifestly inconsistent with the presumption of innocence guaranteed
in Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention."
1240,"They submit in particular
that the applicant did not bring private prosecution proceedings
against the police officers concerned for insult within the meaning of
S. 115 of the Penal Code."
1241,"They further consider that she failed
properly to reason her constitutional complaint as regards the alleged
insults so as to enable the Constitutional Court to assume its
competence to entertain this complaint."
1242,"The applicant considers that her ill-treatment amounted to bodily
assault which had to be prosecuted ex officio and"
1243,"The Commission observes that the basis of the rule of exhaustion
of domestic remedies under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention is
that, before proceedings are brought in an international court, the
state made answerable must have had an opportunity to redress the
alleged damage by domestic means within the framework of its own legal
system (cf. No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57)."
1244,"In respect of
alleged ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention,
the Commission has held that raising criminal charges against the
officials concerned or filing a civil action for compensation are
effective remedies to be exhausted pursuant to Article 26 (Art. 26)
(No. 11208/84, Dec. 4.3.86, D.R. 46 p. 182; No. 10078/82, Dec.
13.12.84, D.R. 41 p. 103; No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57)."
1245," In the present case, the applicant did not bring private
prosecution proceedings against the police officers concerned for
insult, or, assuming that the alleged acts had to be prosecuted ex
officio, lay any criminal charges against the police officers
requesting their prosecution."
1246," In this context, the Commission had
regard to the criminal proceedings instituted against three police
officers upon accusations of ill-treatment raised by the applicant's
husband, which the applicant's husband joined as a private party
claiming compensation."
1247,"In the course of these proceedings, the
allegations of the applicant's husband were carefully examined at two
court levels.
"
1248," The applicant did not institute civil proceedings either, with
a view to claiming compensation in particular as regards the alleged
detrimental consequences of the events in question."
1249,"The
competence of the Constitutional Court to receive complaints about the
violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights is limited under S. 144
para. 1 of the Federal Constitution to formal decisions of
administrative authorities or the exercise of direct administrative
authority and coercion against a particular individual."
1250," The
Constitutional Court, in its decision of 28 November 1989, declared the
applicant's complaint about the alleged insults committed by police
officers in the course of her detention inadmissible in accordance with
its constant case-law, according to which mere insults as such did not
amount to an administrative act relating to the exercise of direct
administrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting remarks
were allegedly made in the course of an official act."
1251,"    In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's
complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not
constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of
exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26)
of the Convention."
1252,"The applicant's submissions do not disclose any special
circumstance which might have absolved her according to the generally
recognised rules of international law from exhausting the effective
domestic remedies at her disposal.
"
1253,"The Commission refers to its above findings that under Austrian
law, the applicant could have brought criminal charges against the
police officers concerned, or filed a civil action for compensation as
regards the alleged detrimental consequences of the events for her
health."
1254,"The Commission first recalls that the guarantees in paras. 2 and
3 (Art. 6-2, 6-3)are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set
forth in para. 1 (Art. 6-1)"
1255,"(cf. e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Unterpertinger
judgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, p. 14, para. 29)."
1256,"(Eur. Court H.R., Klaas judgment of 22 September 1993,
Series A no. 269-A, pp. 17-18, paras. 29-30)."
1257,"(e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Cardot
judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34)."
1258,"A complaint to the Commission must
therefore have been made at least in substance in the proceedings
before the competent domestic organs"
1259,"In the present case that the Commission finds that the first
applicant has not shown that complaints 1(a) to (g), (i) to (n) and (p)
were raised at least in substance before the domestic courts."
1260,"He has
not therefore exhausted the remedies available to him under Swedish law
in respect of these complaints."
1261,"Moreover, the Commission finds no
special circumstance which might have absolved this applicant,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedies at his disposal."
1262," Limiting its examination of the fairness of the proceedings to
the first applicant's complaints 1 (h) and (o), the Commission observes
that he availed himself of his right to challenge Ms. Ekberg's report
by making a request to hear another expert."
1263,"Accordingly, the Commission will have regard to them when examining the
facts under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
1264,"It follows
that it cannot examine whether or not the first applicant was guilty
or innocent."
1265,"It follows that these
complaints must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies
under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
1266,"There is thus no indication
that there was in this respect a lack of ""equality of arms"" between the
first applicant and the prosecution."
1267," In conclusion, there is no indication that the first
applicant was denied a fair trial in this respect."
1268,"in that, as a result, the second
applicant was kept in public care."
1269,"The Commission finds no appearance
of such a violation."
1270,"The first and the second applicant complain that the first
applicant was prohibited from taking the second applicant home on his
release from his pre-trial detention,"
1271,"The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention it may only deal with a complaint within a period of six
months from the date on which the final decision was taken."
1272,"It observes
that the prohibition complained of was issued on 28 January 1991 and
became obsolete at the latest on 20 June 1991, when the County
Administrative Court ordered the second applicant's placement in public
care."
1273,"The present application, however, was lodged on 16 November 1992,
that is more than six months later."
1274,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
1275,"The Commission observes that the refusal at issue dates back to
28 January 1991."
1276,"Examining the complaint under Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the
Convention, the Commission finds no appearance of a violation of these
applicants' rights."
1277,"The Commission finds this complaint
unsubstantiated."
1278,"The Commission recalls that ""family life"" within the meaning of
Article 8 (Art. 8) may include at least the ties between near relatives
such as grandparents and grandchildren (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Marckx
judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, para. 45)."
1279,"However,
the existence of ""family life"" will depend on a number of factors and
on the particular circumstances of each case (cf., e.g., No. 12763/87,
Dec. 14.7.88, D.R. 57 p. 216)."
1280,"The second applicant is the child of the first applicant in his
marriage to S. The first and the second applicant therefore constitute
a ""family"" ipso jure"
1281,"(e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Hokkanen judgment of
23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, para. 54)."
1282,"Moreover, up to his
placement in public care the third and the fourth applicant were
significantly involved in the everyday upbringing of the second
applicant."
1283,"The Commission recalls that the placement order was based on the
1990 Act and was, accordingly, made in accordance with the law."
1284,"The
interference furthermore had the legitimate aims of protecting the
second applicant's ""health or morals"" as well as his ""rights and
freedoms"" in general."
1285,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant."
1286,"(cf.
Eur. Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130,
pp. 31-32, para. 67)."
1287,"Regard must also be
had to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States"
1288,"The Commission's review is not limited to
ascertaining whether the State has exercised its discretion reasonably,
carefully and in good faith."
1289,"It cannot confine itself to considering
the relevant decisions in isolation but must look at them in the light
of the case as a whole."
1290,"It must determine whether the reasons adduced
to justify the interference at issue are ""relevant and sufficient""
(cf. the above-mentioned Olsson judgment, p. 32, para. 68)."
1291,"In the
present case the Commission notes, in particular, the expert evidence
submitted by the second applicant's present therapist, recommending
that the therapy should continue."
1292,"However, before the County
Administrative Court the other applicants gave reason to believe that
they would discontinue this therapy if the second applicant's public
care were to be revoked."
1293,"The Court took this into account when
maintaining public care."
1294,"It further considered that implementation of
the public care in the third and the fourth applicant's home could lead
to a conflict of interests jeopardising the care, given the other
applicants' objections to the therapy provided as well as the third and
the fourth applicant's belief that the first applicant was innocent."
1295," In the light of the above and having regard to the State's margin
of appreciation the Commission finds that the public care of the second
applicant has been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that
the Swedish courts could reasonably find it necessary to maintain his
care."
1296,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can
reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"" within
the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests
of the second applicant."
1297,"The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the
Convention it may only deal with the matter within a period of six
months from the date on which the final decision was taken."
1298,"If the
object of a complaint is not a decision, but an ongoing situation, the
six months' period starts at the time when the situation ceases to
exist (see, e.g., No. 11123/84, Dec. 9.12.87, D.R. 54 p. 52)."
1299," The Commission observes that the second applicant was transferred
from the first ""family home"" to his present ""family home"" on 25 July
1991, whereas the present application was lodged on 16 November 1992,
i.e. more than six months later."
1300,"Furthermore, an examination of the
case does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which
might have interrupted or suspended the running of that period."
1301," The Commission cannot find that the second applicant's placement
in the ""family home"" and the related access restrictions amount to a
deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 (Art. 5) of
the Convention."
1302,"The applicant's request was examined by the Social Council in
December 1992."
1303,"The applicant's appeal to the County Administrative
Court was decided upon in May 1993 following an oral hearing."
1304,"His
further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal was decided upon
in September 1993, also after an oral hearing."
1305,"Leave to appeal was
refused by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.
"
1306,"The court proceedings involving three courts and two oral
hearings thus lasted less than one and a half year."
1307,"(e.g., Eur.
Court H.R., Vernillo judgment of 20 February 1991, Series A no. 198,
p. 12, para. 30)."
1308,"It reiterates that the
reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the
light of the circumstances of each case and having regard to the
following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the
parties and that of the authorities dealing with the case"
1309,"In the light of the
above criteria and having regard to the particular circumstances of the
case the Commission cannot find that this length exceeded a ""reasonable
time""."
1310,"Accordingly, there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1)."
1311,"Assuming
that this provision applies, the Commission observes that under Section
73 of the Social Services Act the third and the fourth applicant had
a right to challenge the Social Council's refusal before the
administrative courts."
1312,"They did not, however, avail themselves of this
opportunity."
1313,"No further issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the
Convention.
"
1314,"The Commission observes that according to the travaux
préparatoires to the 1990 Act a decision not to transfer a child from
a ""family home"" is appealable in administrative court proceedings."
1315,"It
notes, in particular, that in its judgment of 15 September 1993  the
Administrative Court of Appeal examined the first applicant's criticism
of the conditions in the second applicant's ""family home"" in order to
assess whether his public care should be implemented somewhere else."
1316,"In these circumstances the first applicant had access to a court and
there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the
Convention."
1317,No separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13).
1318,"The Commission finds no indication that the first applicant has
challenged the access restrictions at issue by appealing against the
Social Council's care plan to the administrative courts."
1319,"The applicants
have not therefore exhausted the remedies available to them under
Swedish law."
1320,"Moreover, an examination of this complaint does not
disclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have
absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules
of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedies at their
disposal."
1321,"The Commission considers that the access restrictions now at
issue amounted - and amount - to an interference with the third and the
fourth applicant's ""family life""."
1322,"In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2
of Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the
requirement that the interference be ""in accordance with the law""
relates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia,
that the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must
moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him."
1323,"In a sphere
covered by written law, the ""law"" is the enactment in force as the
competent courts have interpreted it"
1324,"The Commission notes that under Section 11 of the 1990 Act the
Social Council may decide how the public care is to be implemented."
1325,"The
Commission is further aware that this provision has been considered by
Swedish courts as constituting the legal basis for access restrictions
concerning, for instance, grandparents (see No. 21608/93, Dec. 22.2.95,
not published)."
1326,"(cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R.,
Kruslin judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, pp. 21-22, para."
1327,"As for the question
whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" in
pursuance of the above aims, the Commission observes that the second
applicant has been allowed to spend one weekend a month in the home of
the third and the fourth applicant, his paternal grandparents, while
being allowed to spend another weekend a month in the home of his
maternal grandparents."
1328,"Special arrangements have apparently been made
for public holidays."
1329,"Recalling its considerations in para. 7 above as
regards the necessity of the public care as implemented in a ""family
home"" and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, the
Commission considers that also the access restrictions now complained
of have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that the
Social Council could reasonably find it necessary to order and maintain
them."
1330,"Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with
the third and the fourth applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1
(Art. 8-1) can reasonably be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic
society"" within the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2)of that provision in
the interests of the second applicant."
1331,"Thus, they cannot, on arguable grounds, claim
to have a ""right"" under domestic law."
1332,"Article 6 (Art. 6) does not
therefore apply in their case."
1333,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted."
1334,"The Commission considers that this complaint could be raised in
civil proceedings instituted by the first applicant for the purpose of
claiming the restoration of the money withdrawn (cf. No. 14451/88, Dec.
2.7.93, not published)."
1335,No such action has been brought.
1336,"The Commission
recalls that where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a remedy
that remedy must be tried (e.g., No. 10148/82, Dec. 14.3.85, D.R. 42
p. 98)."
1337," In the above circumstances the Commission finds that it has not
been shown that domestic remedies have been exhausted."
1338,"Moreover, an
examination of the complaint does not disclose the existence of any
special circumstance which might have absolved the applicants,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law, from
exhausting the domestic remedy at their disposal."
1339,"Leaving aside the question of Sweden's reservation to this
provision, as valid at the relevant time, the Commission observes that
the situation complained of ceased to exist in 1991 when the second
applicant started attending elementary school."
1340,"The application,
however, was lodged with the Commission on 16 November 1992."
1341,"Furthermore, an examination of the case does not disclose the existence
of any special circumstances which might have interrupted or suspended
the running of the six month period provided for in Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention."
1342," The Commission, examining this complaint in the light of the
above-cited Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, cannot find any
evidence that the first applicant has requested access to the notes
concerned."
1343,"It has therefore not been shown that domestic remedies have
been exhausted."
1344,"Moreover, an examination of the complaint does not
disclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have
absolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules
of international law, from exhausting the domestic remedy at their
disposal."
1345,"(cf.,
e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Stanford judgment of 23 February 1994, Series
A no. 280-A, para. 24)."
1346,"The Commission's task is to
ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair"
1347,"As a general rule, however, it is for the
domestic courts to assess the evidence before them, in particular since
they have the benefit of hearing witnesses and assessing their
credibility"
1348,"The Commission is
normally not competent to deal with a complaint alleging that errors
of law and fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where
it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation
of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or one of
its Protocols, for instance in that a judgment has no legal
justification and thereby violates a party's right to receive a fair
trial (cf. No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45)."
1349,"The Commission also recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of
the Convention it may only deal with a complaint after all domestic
remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised
rules under international law."
1350,"(cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom
judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121-A, p. 32-33, para. 73)."
1351,"In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the
fourth applicant, the Commission recalls that in order for Article 6
para. 1 (Art. 6-1) to apply to the proceedings in question it must
first be ascertained whether there was a dispute over a ""right"" which
can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under
domestic law"
1352,"Under
Swedish law the third and the fourth applicant have no right of access
to the second applicant."
1353,"Such an obligation
confers upon the applicant a right of a procedural nature
distinguishable from the substantive rights set out under Section I of
the Convention or under its Protocols."
1354,"It flows from the very essence
of this right that it must be open to individuals to complain of
alleged infringements of it in the proceedings before the Commission."
1355,"In this respect the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing
rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and
illusory"
1356,"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,
the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been
exhausted. It follows that this complaint must also be rejected under
Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention."
1357," The Commission recalls that Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) of the
Convention imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to
interfere with the right of the individual effectively to present and
pursue his application before the Commission."
1358,"(e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Cruz Varas and Others judgment of
20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, pp. 35-36, para. 99)."
1359," The
Commission, taking into account the applicant's position in these
proceedings and the impact of their outcome on her own financial
situation,"
1360,"They submit that the applicant
failed to complain about the length in the course of the domestic court
proceedings and did not lodge a request under S. 91 of the Court
Organisation Act 1990 (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) that, in view of the
alleged delay, the superior court should fix an appropriate time-limit
for the conduct of the court proceedings."
1361,"According to Article 26 (Art. 26), the ""Commission may only deal
with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted,
according to the generally recognised rules of international law"".
"
1362," The Commission notes that S. 91 of the Austrian Court
Organisation Act, which entitles the parties to court proceedings to
lodge a request with the superior court to fix a time limit in respect
of a delayed procedural step, entered into force on 1 January 1990 when
the proceedings in question were already pending for one year."
1363,"At that
stage, the District Court had already been dealing with the applicant's
request of December 1988 and, in its decision of 10 August 1989,
postponed the examination thereof, and the Regional Court had decided
on the applicant's appeal on 29 November 1989."
1364,"The Commission finds that it is thus not faced with the issue of
an alleged absence of any reaction of the competent court to a
procedural request (cf. No. 19369/92, Dec. 8.1.93, not published)."
1365,"In
the circumstances of the present case, a request under S. 91 of the
Court Organisation Act cannot be considered as an effective remedy to
ensure, regarding the proceedings as a whole, a determination of the
applicant's civil rights and obligations within a ""reasonable time""
within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention."
1366,"As regards the merits of the complaint, the Government, referring
to the case-law of the Convention organs, argue that the length of the
proceedings was mainly due to the complexity of the case."
1367,"In this
respect, they refer to the numerous other matters related to the
proceedings at issue, and the proceedings before the Vienna Juvenile
Court."
1368,"that she filed numerous
submissions"
1369,"thereby caused difficulties to survey the file and to
decide upon all of her requests in due time."
1370,"The Commission considers, in the light of the criteria
established by the case-law of the Convention institutions on the
question of ""reasonable time"""
1371,"the complexity of the case,"
1372,"the
applicant's conduct and that of the competent authorities), and having
regard to all the information in its possession"
1373,"that a thorough
examination of this complaint is required, both as to the law and as
to the facts."
1374,"The respondent Government submit that detention at Her Majesty's
pleasure is to be equated with the term of mandatory life imprisonment
for adults and is in effect the equivalent sentence imposed on
juveniles."
1375,"It is therefore to be regarded as a sentence fixed by law
in respect of the gravity of the offence concerned."
1376,"They submit that
mandatory and discretionary life sentences differ in fundamental
respects, both in nature and applicable procedures."
1377,"Pursuant to the
judgments of the Court, Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) does not grant an
entitlement  to a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence to
periodic judicial assessment of the grounds for his detention after the
expiry of his tariff"
1378,"(cf. Eur. Court H.R., Weeks judgment of
2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment
of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A)."
1379,"It should be assimilated to discretionary life sentences for
adults in respect of which the European Court of Human Rights has held
that Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention requires judicial rather than
executive control after the expiry of the punitive or ""tariff"" part of
their sentence."
1380,"Since the only justification for his detention is risk
or ""dangerousness"", which is a factor susceptible to change,"
1381,"Her Majesty's Pleasure does not satisfy the
requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) since the Parole Board,
save immediately after recall, is unable to order release, the ultimate
decision resting with the executive. An applicant also has no right to
an oral hearing before the Board or to call his own witnesses or to
question the witnesses against him.

      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the
parties concerning the complaints raised by the applicant."
1382,"It considers
that the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law the
determination of which should depend on an examination on the merits."
1383,"since the Parole Board,
save immediately after recall, is unable to order release, the ultimate
decision resting with the executive."
1384,"An applicant also has no right to
an oral hearing before the Board or to call his own witnesses or to
question the witnesses against him."
1385,"They add, in this respect, that although the offence under Section 5
of the Road Traffic Act was not, as such, in force at the date of the
reservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road
users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users.
"
1386,"To the extent that the absence of an oral hearing is raised, the
respondent Government also rely on the Austrian reservation to Article
6 (Art. 6) of the Convention."
1387,"They also point out that the applicant
did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the
Administrative Court."
1388,"because it cannot cover offences which were not in force
at the date of the reservation."
1389," In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal
Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision
provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds
which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made"
1390,"The Government point out that any appeal
lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to
comprehensive review."
1391,"The applicant in this respect considers that the
Constitutional Court's jurisdiction has been limited subsequ
entry into force of Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution,"
1392,"as it is not intended to have legally binding effects on the
interpretation."
1393,"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed
on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case
on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988,
whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988."
1394," With regard to the declaration made by Austria when
ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the
declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the
Convention"
1395,"Finally, they consider that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7
(P7-4) has in any event been complied with as it applies only where the
facts and legal provisions are to be regarded as a unit."
1396,"Thus, they
conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings
being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that
if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may
nevertheless be convicted under these. "
1397,"The Government underline that
the offence of causing death under the influence of drink contained in
Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code is different in character from
the provision of Section 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act"
1398,"The applicant underlines that for
the individual concerned the principle ""ne bis in idem"" must apply to
every punishable act, and not merely to the provision of law."
1399,"He
points out that both criminal and administrative authorities apply a
level of 0.8 per mille as constituting a state of inebriation.
"
1400,"as
it is not clear whether it covers double or multiple convictions only
by the Austrian criminal courts, or double or multiple convictions by
Austrian criminal courts on the one hand and Austrian administrative
criminal authorities on the other."
1401,"The Commission finds that the complaint relating to the
presumption of innocence was not made in the applicant's application
form or in correspondence with the Commission's Secretariat. "
1402,"The mere
fact that, by virtue of general words a complaint is not excluded from
an application, is not sufficient to regard that complaint as having
been made. "
1403,"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed
on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case
on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988,
whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988."
1404,"The
Government submit that because the Administrative Court is required to
review a decision under administrative criminal law on the basis of the
substantive law at the date of commission of the offence (or at the
date of the first instance decision if more advantageous to a
defendant), the fact that the Administrative Court took its decision
five months after the Protocol had entered into force does not affect
the position"
1405,"The Commission finds that these complaints raise complex issues
of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the
Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the
Convention, the Austrian declaration to Protocol No. 7 (P7) to the
Convention and questions concerning the competence of the Commission
ratione temporis to deal with the complaints under Protocol No. 7 (P7),
the determination of which must be reserved to an examination of the
merits."
1406,"This part of the application must accordingly be rejected
under Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3)
of the Convention as having been introduced out of time."
1407,"The Commission observes that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is an
association of parliamentarians from all over the world, set up inter
alia to unite parliamentarians in common action and to advance
international peace and cooperation."
1408,"The Union is a non-governmental
organisation."
1409,"The organs of the Union may adopt resolutions which are
communicated by the parliamentarians concerned to the national
parliaments and to international organisations.
"
1410,"The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27
para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention."
1411,"It considers that the
term ""another procedure"" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention."
1412,"Moreover, the
term ""international investigation or settlement"" refers to institutions
and procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental
bodies.
"
1413,"The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union
constitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para.
1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and
procedures. "
1414,"Reference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's
passport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992
prohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the
Public Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant
from seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention
up to 7 September 1992."
1415," The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from
7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the
Commission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention
to receive individual petitions."
1416," On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to
the period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared
inadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions
of the Convention."
1417,"However, the applicant's various complaints raise
different issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione
temporis."
1418," It is
submitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission
on 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date
on which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the
applicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been
exhausted."
1419,"Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""the Commission may
only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been
exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international
law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final
decision was taken""."
1420,"The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort
dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992."
1421,"The applicant then
filed his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992."
1422,"On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further
appeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a
complaint with the Prosecutor General."
1423,"The applicant filed an appeal
with the Prosecutor General which the latter dismissed on 11 November
1992. "
1424,"Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the
applicant submitted his application form to the Commission.
"
1425," The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also
complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention."
1426,"The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating
to a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force
of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione
temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of
Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.
"
1427,"   In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the
final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e.
before 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the
Convention in respect of Bulgaria."
1428,"After the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed
a request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor
General dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no
new circumstances justifying modification of detention."
1429,"In his view,
confirmation herefor can be seen in the decision of 12 August 1992
which banned meetings between the applicant and his lawyers, thereby
indicating that the true purpose of his detention was to restrict his
right actively and freely to express his political views as a member
of the National Assembly."
1430," The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries
is not an offence under Bulgarian law. "
1431,"However, this is not the
correct formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were
brought against the applicant and other persons."
1432,"The Government also refer in this context to the Convention
organs' case-law, in particular the Bozano case, according to which,
where the Convention refers back to domestic law as in Article 5
para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c), the Convention organs' supervisory powers are
limited since it is in the first place for the national authorities,
notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Eur. Court
H.R., judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 58)."
1433," The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no
other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in
Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention."
1434," He complains in particular that
the authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of
various medical experts;  as a result, his health seriously
deteriorated."
1435,"For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had
worse basic indicators of his blood count."
1436,"Twice he had to undergo
treatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital."
1437,"He was sent to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital despite the danger of
infections posing a risk to his health and life.
"
1438,"The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to
Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention."
1439,"The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date
on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria,
medical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and
28 August 1992."
1440,"Thereafter, further reports were issued on 16 September 1992 and
on 2 October 1992."
1441,"These reports were prepared by numerous medical
experts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist."
1442,"It transpires
from these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic
lympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart."
1443,"While
the applicant had apparently suffered from angina pectoris, there was
no sign of a myocardial infarct."
1444,"In particular, a problem could arise under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the
Convention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him."
1445,"On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention
entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was
transferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National
Investigation Service."
1446," However, following a deterioration of his
cardiovascular condition on 10 and 11 September 1992, he was taken to
the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute."
1447," In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the
applicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital
environment."
1448,"The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain
medication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical
supervision at a hospital."
1449,"As a result, the applicant remained at the
Higher Military Medical Institute until 30 November 1992 when he
returned to the National Investigation Service."
1450,"A week later, when his
health deteriorated, he was again taken to the Higher Military Medical
Institute."
1451,"On 30 December 1992 he was released from detention.
"
1452," The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was
monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their
recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required
medical treatment."
1453,"Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his
detention was spent in hospital."
1454,"At one stage he was even brought to
the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute."
1455,"Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter
alia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was
brought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious
diseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with
any particular illness while in hospital."
1456,"They continuously reviewed the
detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's
health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.
"
1457,"  On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the
applicant's state of ill-health."
1458,"The applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the
Convention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on
13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons
being present."
1459,"However, the fact complained of relates to a period
prior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
1460,"  The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the
applicant have not yet been terminated. "
1461,"He has not, therefore, been
""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1
(Art. 7-1) of the Convention."
1462," The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a
violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention."
1463,"The
applicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order
of 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article
published on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written
materials to his lawyers."
1464,"The prohibition was renewed in November
1992."
1465,"The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully
carried into effect until the end of August and in early September
1992."
1466,"In fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's
contacts with his lawyers."
1467," While in detention the applicant wrote
altogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared
after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into
force in respect of Bulgaria."
1468,"He also wrote a book which was published
after his release."
1469,"The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this
prohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992."
1470," In
the Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently
established any interferences with his right to freedom of expression
after 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of
the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.
"
1471,"(see No. 9044/80, Chartier v. Italy, Comm. Report
8.12.92, D.R. 33, p. 41 et seq., at p. 58)."
1472,"Indeed, when preparing their reports,
the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health
of the years 1988-1990."
1473,"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international
investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1
(b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention."
1474, The Government submitted that the applicant’s allegations were based on the assumption that the judges had been involved in the matter as complainants and had therefore had a personal interest in the subsequent proceedings.
1475,They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions.
1476,They were not proceedings brought by one of the parties or by a complainant.
1477,hey constituted a sui generis procedure aimed at securing the unimpeded functioning of the courts and safeguarding the authority of the judiciary.
1478,The proceedings were not adversarial in the sense that one person was opposed to another; they concerned the integrity of the judicial system.
1479,No single judge had any interest in them.
1480,The long-established power granted to common-law courts to sanction improper conduct committed in their face was a necessary and indispensable element of a fair trial itself.
1481,The Assize Court’s own duty to ensure a fair trial of the persons accused of murder in the present case required it to possess the summary power to deal with any contempt before it.
1482,"The Government further maintained that, in order to be effective, the judicial power to sanction attempts by any person in the courtroom to dominate the court and determine the course of the trial had to be exercised immediately."
1483,Otherwise the person in contempt would in effect have achieved his purpose.
1484,"Moreover, if contempt proceedings had been brought before a different bench, there would have been certain undesirable consequences that could not have been overlooked: the members of the bench would have had to testify about the events which had taken place before their eyes."
1485,Their credibility in connection with the facts of which they had become aware while performing their functions would have had to have been tested by other judges and the very integrity of the judiciary would accordingly have been unnecessarily questioned.
1486," According to the Government, the applicant would have been entitled to allege a breach of the impartiality rule only on the (incorrect) assumption that the Assize Court had been acting in a personal capacity in trying him."
1487,"Furthermore, the fact that the applicant had been able to appeal to the Supreme Court, a judicial body with full jurisdiction to review facts and law, cured any possible breach of the impartiality requirement."
1488,"The Supreme Court had independently found that the applicant had been guilty of the offence of contempt, and had upheld the sentence imposed by the Assize Court."
1489,"Applying the criteria established by the case-law of the Court (see Engel and others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, §§ 82-83; Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, §§ 48-50), namely a)"
1490,"the domestic classification of the offence, b) the nature of the offence, and c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring,"
1491,"The offence was classified in domestic law as criminal, it was not confined to the applicant’s status as a lawyer, the maximum possible sentence was one month’s imprisonment and the sentence actually imposed on the applicant was 5 days’ imprisonment"
1492,"(see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, §§ 82-86, ECHR 2003-X)."
1493, The Court considers that the decisive feature of the case is that the judges of the court which convicted the applicant were the same judges before whom the contempt was allegedly committed.
1494,"The Government’s assertion that the judges who convicted the applicant cannot be considered complainants in the proceedings and had no personal interest in the relevant offence but were simply defending the authority and standing of the court is, in the opinion of the Court, theoretical."
1495,The reality is that courts are not impersonal institutions but function through the judges who compose them.
1496,It is the judges who interpret a certain act or type of conduct as contempt of court.
1497,"Whether a contempt has been committed must be assessed on the basis of the particular judges’ own personal understanding, feelings, sense of dignity and standards of behaviour."
1498,Justice is offended if the judges feel that it has been.
1499,Their personal feelings are brought to bear in the process of judging whether there has been a contempt of court.
1500,Their own perception and evaluation of the facts and their own judgment are engaged in this process.
1501,The Court endorses in this respect the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Offutt v. USA (348 U.S. 11. 75 S.Ct.11):
1502,"“But judges also are human, and may, in a human way, quite unwittingly identify offence to self with obstruction to law. "
1503,"Accordingly, this Court has deemed it important that district judges guard against this easy confusion by not sitting themselves in judgment upon misconduct of counsel where the contempt charged is entangled with the judge’s personal feeling against the lawyer”."
1504," In this connection, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court acknowledged that as “persons” they were “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns, and emphasised the importance for them of upholding the authority and integrity of justice."
1505,"In fact, with the exception of Cyprus, this is the practice in the High Contracting Parties to the Convention as regards behaviour which constitutes the criminal offence of contempt of court."
1506,"The situation regarding sanctions of a disciplinary nature, in the form of fines, imposed for behaviour which does not attract criminal liability, is different (Ravnsborg v. Sweden, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283‑B)."
1507,"As regards the applicant’s contention concerning the subjective bias of the judges of the Assize Court, the Court notes that the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the Court’s case-law (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58)."
1508,The personal impartiality of each judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid.).
1509,"This was triggered, to some extent, by the court’s interpretation of the word “ravasakia” as “love letters” instead of “notes” although that word has two possible different meanings (see § 23 above), the particular context in which it was used and the applicant’s statement that he saw:
“with [his] own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to an other when [he] was cross-examining ...”."
1510," In this respect, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court stated that the applicant “did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to an exchange of ""ravasakia"", that is, ""love letters""” and acknowledged that as “persons” they had been “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns."
1511,"The lack of impartiality is evidenced by the intemperate reaction of the judges to the conduct of the applicant, as evidenced by their haste to try him summarily for the criminal offence of contempt of court without availing themselves of other alternative, less drastic, measures such as a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, refusing to hear the applicant unless he withdrew his statements, or asking him to leave the courtroom."
1512,"“If the Court’s reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow (καταστροφικό)”."
1513,The Court also finds relevant in this connection its observations and conclusions below regarding the complaints of breach of the presumption of innocence and insufficient information as to the nature and cause of the change against the applicant (paragraphs 52-58 and 65-68).
1514," In this respect an additional important factor is the harsh punishment - immediate imprisonment - which they imposed on the applicant while stating, for example:
i) “We cannot conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person...”"
1515," According to the Court’s case-law, it is possible for a higher tribunal, in certain circumstances, to make reparation for an initial violation of the Convention"
1516,"(see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 19, § 33)."
1517,"However, in the present case, the Court observes that the Supreme Court agreed with the approach of the first instance court, i.e. that the latter could itself try a case of criminal contempt committed in its face, and rejected the applicant’s complaints which are now before this Court."
1518,There was no retrial of the case by the Supreme Court.
1519,"As a court of appeal, the Supreme Court did not have full competence to deal de novo with the case, but could only review the first instance judgment for possible legal or manifest factual errors."
1520,"It did not carry out an ab initio, independent determination of the criminal charge against the applicant for contempt of the Assize Court."
1521,"Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that it could not interfere with the judgment of the Assize Court, accepting that that court had a margin of appreciation in imposing a sentence on the applicant."
1522,"Indeed, although the Supreme Court had the power to quash the impugned decision on the ground that the composition of the Assize Court had not been such as to guarantee its impartiality, it declined to do so."
1523, The Court also notes that the appeal did not have a suspensive effect on the judgment of the Assize Court.
1524,"In this connection, it observes that the applicant’s conviction and sentence became effective under domestic criminal procedure on the same day as the delivery of the judgment by the Assize Court, i.e. on 14 February 2001."
1525,"The applicant filed his appeal the next day, on 15 February 2001, whilst he was serving the five-day sentence of imprisonment."
1526,"The decision on appeal was delivered on 2 April 2001, long after the sentence had been served."
1527," In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that any defect in the proceedings of the Assize Court was cured on appeal by the Supreme Court."
1528,"The Court accepts that the facts, as disclosed by the minutes of the relevant proceedings and the final decision of the Assize Court, reveal that a degree of personal partiality did indeed emerge on the part of the judges during their discussion with the applicant."
1529,"In conclusion, the Court considers that there has been a breach of the principle of impartiality, on the basis of both the objective and subjective tests."
1530,"The judges had applied the presumption automatically in their decision-making process, but the facts before them had been such as to rebut that presumption."
1531,"All judges were imbued with the necessity of upholding the presumption of innocence, and automatically applied it without having to state expressly in every case that they had done so."
1532,"The fact that the court had stated that what had been said prima facie constituted contempt, and invited representations on the matter, could not be considered a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention."
1533,"If the applicant had produced a good explanation for what he had said, he would not have been found in contempt."
1534,It was totally unrealistic to suggest that the court had closed its mind to this possibility.
1535,The presumption of innocence required the court to refrain from taking any decision as to the applicant’s guilt until all parties had had an opportunity to make representations.
1536,"It was clear that the court had made up its mind as to his guilt immediately, and all he had been offered was an opportunity to enter a plea in mitigation as to sentence."
1537,"That was clear from the Assize Court’s judgment, where it was stated “Later, after a long break, Mr Kyprianou was given a second chance to say something to the Court, in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour”."
1538,The Court recalls that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention is one of the constituent elements of a fair criminal trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1.
1539," In the present case the Court notes, on the basis of the minutes of the relevant proceedings, that the Assize Court formed and expressed an opinion during its discussion with the applicant amounting to a conclusion that it considered him guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court."
1540,"In particular, following the court’s refusal to grant him leave to withdraw from the case and his statement regarding the exchange of “ravasakia” between the judges, the court stated the following:"
1541,“We consider that what has just been said by Mr Kyprianou and in particular the manner with which he addresses to the Court constitutes a contempt of court and Mr Kyprianou has two choices: either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him or for him to decide whether he should retract.
1542,We give him this opportunity exceptionally. 
1543,Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law applies to its full extent”.
1544,"In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant was given little opportunity to react to the possibility of such a finding or put forward his own explanations and representations in this respect."
1545,"Furthermore, following the applicant’s persistence and a second short break, the court reaffirmed its view by stating that:"
1546,"“We continue to believe that what Mr Kyprianou said, the content, the manner and the tone of his voice, constitute a contempt of Court as provided in Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law 14/60”."
1547,"The Court agrees with the applicant that, essentially, he was asked for mitigation rather than given a full opportunity to defend himself against a charge which would have grave consequences for his liberty."
1548,"In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Assize Court violated the principle of the presumption of innocence."
1549,"The Court recalls that the fairness of proceedings must be assessed with regard to the case as a whole (see, for example, Miailhe v. France (No. 2), judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports 1996‑IV, p. 1338, § 43, and Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, pp. 13-14, § 38)."
1550,Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention underlines the need for special attention to be paid to informing the defendant of the “accusation”.
1551,"It affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the “cause” of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts."
1552,"That information should be detailed (see Pélissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, § 51, ECHR 1999‑II)."
1553,The scope of this provision must be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
1554," In the present case, the Court observes that the applicant was informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him by the Assize Court after the court had already formed the view that the applicant was guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court (see §§ 53‑56 above)."
1555,"Furthermore, the material facts which influenced the court’s decision, as expressed in the decision of the majority to impose a prison sentence on him, were not disclosed before that decision."
1556,"These facts were, first, that the Assize Court interpreted the word “ravasakia” to mean “love letters” rather than “notes”; secondly, the court’s objections regarding the applicant’s tone of voice and his gestures to the court which had created “a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court”; and thirdly, the Assize Court’s view that the applicant had accused the court of restricting him and of “doing justice in secret”."
1557,The Court reiterates it findings concerning the review by the Supreme Court (§§ 43-46 above) and the failure to remedy the defects in the proceedings of the Assize Court on appeal.
1558," The applicant submitted that his case had received extensive publicity in Cyprus and abroad, something which had caused him severe stress, mental suffering and aggravation."
1559,"He maintained that the wide and adverse media coverage over a number of months had affected his own and his family’s life and reputation, as well as his professional and political career."
1560,"In the latter connection, he referred to the fact that he had withdrawn his candidacy for membership of parliament in the 2001 elections, due to the embarrassment which he felt."
1561,"The applicant argued that he had been humiliated and treated like a common criminal despite the fact that he had been a law-abiding citizen, a member of parliament and an advocate for about 40 years, with an unblemished record."
1562,He was not a convicted prisoner or guilty of such undeserving conduct as to justify a refusal of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention; he had simply been defending his client in a murder trial.
1563,He emphasised that his complaint was not that the events caused his condition but that they had contributed to its deterioration.
1564,He pointed out that diabetics required special medical attention on a daily basis which he had not received during the five days spent in prison.
1565,"He claimed that, following his imprisonment, he had had to undergo treatment."
1566,"The applicant relied on medical reports which revealed that his condition had been stable for a long period (since 1998) but, immediately after his imprisonment, he had suffered serious complications."
1567,The applicant had been found guilty of a violation of the criminal law which both the Assize Court and the Supreme Court had considered to be sufficiently serious to justify a prison sentence.
1568,"The applicant’s background and distinguished position should not entitle him to receive any more compensation than any other prisoner who had endured prison life, with its consequent deprivation of liberty, body searches, proximity to other criminals and communal sanitary facilities."
1569, The Government argued that any loss of reputation and adverse publicity allegedly suffered by the applicant had been a consequence of his own unprofessional and offensive conduct rather than his conviction and imprisonment.
1570,It was inevitable that the public’s perception of his ability as a lawyer and as a politician would be affected by the publicity surrounding his case.
1571,"On an objective assessment of the facts, the applicant’s conduct had been inappropriate and of questionable benefit to his client."
1572,They claimed that the medical reports he had provided did not establish any causal link.
1573,"Indeed, they pointed out that the applicant had already been suffering from retinopathy for two years before his imprisonment (since December 1998), and that it was not uncommon for diabetic retinopathy to develop over time to include macular oedema."
1574,The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case.
1575,"In particular, it considers that the seriousness of the conviction and the prison sentence imposed on the applicant must have had a negative impact on his professional reputation and on his political image, particularly in a small country like Cyprus."
1576,"However, the Court does not find that the applicant has established a causal link between the deterioration of his health and the breaches of the Convention which it has found."
1577,"Further, they emphasised that there was no dispute over the underlying facts as to what had happened."
1578, where the facts constituting the offence were to be proved through witnesses.
1579,"Although there is authority for the proposition that, if a violation of the principle of impartiality is found, it is not necessary to examine other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention"
1580,"(see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, § 80)"
1581,"As has been noted in several previous judgments by the Court, the campaign of terrorism waged in Northern Ireland over the last quarter of a century has taken a terrible toll, especially in terms of human life and suffering (see paragraph 35 above)."
1582,The Court sees no reason to depart from the general approach it has adopted in previous cases of a similar nature.
1583,"(see, inter alia, the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 15, para. 28, citing the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 27, para. 48)."
1584,"They also pointed to a number of other facts capable of supporting, albeit indirectly, the reasonableness of the suspicion, including notably the findings made by the domestic courts in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, the very recent conviction of her brothers in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her own visits to the USA and her contacts with her brothers there (see especially paragraphs 10, 19, 24, 25, 28 and 29 above)."
1585,"Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism."
1586,"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention."
1587,She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one.
1588,She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion.
1589,"In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D.
54.  For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley."
1590,It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers.
1591," With regard to the level of ""suspicion"", the Court would note firstly that, as was observed in its judgment in the case of Brogan and Others, ""sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) does not presuppose that the [investigating authorities] should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while [the arrested person is] in custody."
1592,"Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others"" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53)."
1593,The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.
1594,"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation."
1595,The length of the deprivation of liberty at risk may also be material to the level of suspicion required.
1596," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
1597," With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts."
1598,The Court would firstly reiterate its recognition that the use of confidential information is essential in combating terrorist violence and the threat that organised terrorism poses to the lives of citizens and to democratic society as a whole
1599,"(see also the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 48)."
1600,"This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49)."
1601,"As to the present case, the terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland, the carnage it has caused over the years and the active engagement of the Provisional IRA in that campaign are established beyond doubt."
1602,The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law.
1603,"That finding is not altered by the fact that the terms of the applicable legislation were amended in 1987 as a result of the Baker Report so as to include a requirement that the arrest should be based on reasonable, rather than merely honest, suspicion (see paragraph 37 above)."
1604,The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.
1605,"Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition ""furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (see paragraph 51 above)."
1606,"In this connection, unlike in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Convention institutions have had the benefit of the review that the national courts conducted of the facts and of Mrs Murray’s allegations in the civil proceedings brought by her."
1607,"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention."
1608,At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.
1609,"In the action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, the High Court judge, after having heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility, found that she had genuinely been suspected of having been involved in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms in the USA for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 24 above)."
1610,"The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a ""transparently honest witness"", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above)."
1611,"Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above)."
1612,Some weeks before her arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had been convicted in the USA of offences connected with purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).
1613,"As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above)."
1614,"The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland."
1615," Having regard to the level of factual justification required at the stage of suspicion and to the special exigencies of investigating terrorist crime, the Court finds, in the light of all the above considerations, that there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs Murray may have committed the offence of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA. "
1616,"She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above)."
1617,"However, in this context it is not normally within the province of the Court to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them"
1618,"(see, among other authorities, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 19-20, para. 43, in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e); and the Klaas v. Germany judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, para. 29, in relation to Article 3 (art. 3))."
1619,In the present case no cogent elements have been produced by the first applicant in the proceedings before the Convention institutions which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact made by the Northern Ireland courts.
1620, Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above).
1621,"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53)."
1622,"As the domestic courts pointed out (see paragraphs 25 in fine, 29 in fine and 34 in fine above), in view of her persistent refusal to answer any questions at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 19 above) it is not surprising that the authorities were not able to make any headway in pursuing the suspicions against her."
1623,"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority."
1624,What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form.
1625,"Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive."
1626,The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).
1627,"The first applicant also alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, which provides:"
1628,"""Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him."""
1629,"Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA."
1630,"The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D.
74.  The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested."
1631,"According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence"
1632,"since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place."
1633,"It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above)."
1634,"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41)."
1635,"During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above)."
1636,Mrs Murray testified that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA and about her contacts with them but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence (see paragraph 19 above).
1637,Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray.
1638,"This is not perhaps surprising since the trial took place over three years after the events - Mrs Murray having waited eighteen months before bringing her action - and Corporal D., although present, had not taken an active part in the interview (see paragraphs 14, 16, 17 and 21 above)."
1639,"Corporal D. did however remember that questions had been asked about money and about America and the trial judge found her to be a ""transparently honest witness"" (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above)."
1640,"Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above)."
1641,"In the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA."
1642,"Admittedly, ""there was never any probing examination of her collecting money"" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above)."
1643,Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).
1644,The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.
1645,In the context of the present case this interval cannot be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).
1646,"They disputed that the impugned measures all formed an integral part of Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention or that the domestic courts had affirmed their lawfulness, in particular as concerns the retention of the records including the photograph of Mrs Murray."
1647,Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above).
1648,The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).
1649,The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above). 
1650,"The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords also confirmed that the Army’s implied lawful authority under section 14 extended to interrogating a detained person and to recording personal details of the kind contained in the standard record form (see paragraph 41 above and also paragraphs 15, 30 and 34)."
1651,It is implicit in the judgments of the national courts that the retention of such details was covered by the same lawful authority derived from section 14 (see paragraph 41 in fine above).
1652,"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above)."
1653,The impugned measures thus had a basis in domestic law.
1654,"It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."
1655,In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime
1656,A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.
1657,"The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above)."
1658,These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes
1659,The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above).
1660,"The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above)."
1661,"The Court accepts that there was in principle a need both for powers of the kind granted by section 14 of the 1978 Act and, in the particular case, to enter and search the home of the Murray family in order to arrest Mrs Murray."
1662,"Furthermore, the ""conditions of extreme tension"", as Lord Griffiths put it in his speech in the House of Lords, under which such arrests in Northern Ireland have to be carried out must be recognised."
1663,"The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above):
""The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ... It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned."""
1664,These are legitimate considerations which go to explain and justify the manner in which the entry into and search of the applicants’ home were carried out.
1665,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 28, para. 59)."
1666," (see the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 23, para. 49)."
1667,Neither can it be regarded as falling outside the legitimate bounds of the process of investigation of terrorist crime for the competent authorities to record and retain basic personal details concerning the arrested person or even other persons present at the time and place of arrest.
1668,None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above).
1669,Similar conclusions apply to the taking and retention of a photograph of Mrs Murray at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).
1670,"The Court does not find that, in relation to any of the applicants, the means employed by the authorities in this regard were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
1671,"In this connection too, the Court does not find that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued."
1672, It was not contested that the impugned measures interfered with the applicants’ exercise of their right to respect for their private and family life and their home.
1673,"The Court discerns no reason, on the material before it, for not concluding that each of the various measures was ""in accordance with the law"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
1674, These measures undoubtedly pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.
1675," In the light of the particular facts of the case, the Court finds that the various measures complained of can be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2)."
1676,"(see the Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258-B, p. 57, para. 76), which provides:"
1677,"notably in the Brogan and Others and Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgments (loc. cit., pp. 34-35, para. 65, and pp. 20-21, para. 45, respectively)."
1678,"  Under the Convention scheme of protection of the right to liberty and security of person, the lex specialis as regards entitlement to a remedy is paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4)"
1679,"""Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."""
1680,No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.
1681,since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.
1682,Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order.
1683,"Its effect is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent ""national authority"" both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief in meritorious cases (see, inter alia, the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, para. 122, and the authorities cited there)."
1684,The remedy available to Mrs Murray would have satisfied these conditions.
1685,Whether the relevant domestic law as applied to Mrs Murray ensured her a sufficient level of protection of her right to respect for her private life is a substantive issue under Article 8 (art. 8).
1686,The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).
1687,Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority
1688,"(see the James and Others judgment, loc. cit.)."
1689,"Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the ""co-operative"" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal."
1690,These circumstances may give rise only to a bona fide suspicion of such complicity.
1691,"They do not give rise to a ""reasonable"" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence."
1692,"No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment)."
1693,"Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest. "
1694,"From the recorded questions about her brothers or ""about money and about America"", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her ""that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA""."
1695,"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty."
1696,"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)""."
1697,"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case."
1698,"With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life."
1699,In the exercise of this power of review the Court must ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by this provision of the Convention has been secured.
1700,"As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, since Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention were in breach of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), she was entitled to an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with this provision."
1701,"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5)."
1702,The alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is directly linked with the issues under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention.
1703,"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2)."
1704,"because of the short duration of the detention,"
1705,"once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means ""that she was suspected of having committed a given offence""."
1706,"Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow."
1707,"This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest."
1708,"This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence."
1709,"In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because
""it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"",
which induces the Court to come to the conclusion that
""the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview""."
1710,"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future."
1711,"In fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand ""the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him""."
1712, It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).
1713,"If it is sustained, then it would mean that the guarantee therein contemplated will only come into play in situations such as that which is described in Franz Kafka’s masterpiece The Trial, where the Inspector, who is supposed to interrogate K (the accused person), tells K ,
""I can’t even confirm that you are charged with an offence, or rather I don’t know whether you are."
1714,"You are under arrest certainly, more than that I do not know."" "
1715,"English translation by W. and E. Muir from the German original Der Prozess – Penguin reprint 1953, p. 18."
1716," In the examination of the matter of ""reasonable suspicion"", the key issue seems to me to be whether ""at least some facts or information"" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence."
1717,In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled.
1718,"It was suggested by the representative of the Government that ""primary facts"", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from ""something other than the primary facts or information""."
1719,"Elements of the latter kind, he claimed, had been provided which should be capable of so satisfying an objective observer."
1720,"He cited:
(a)  the honest belief of the arresting officer,
(b)  the briefing by a superior officer, and
(c)  circumstances preventing disclosure of information."
1721,"In my view all three are capable of satisfying the condition of an honest or genuine suspicion, but do not constitute ""at least some facts or information"" on which a reasonable suspicion could be based."
1722,"Neither honesty of an arresting officer, nor honesty of superior officer, nor the circumstances of a suspected terrorist crime fall into this category."
1723,"At the hearing the Government’s representative also identified three other kinds of more specific ""objective evidence"", namely the conviction of the first applicant’s brothers, her contacts with them and her visits to America."
1724,"The problem with these facts, as I see it, is that none of them per se may be held against the first applicant to incriminate her."
1725,"They rather resemble the incrimination of a person’s status, in this case the first applicant’s kinship relationship."
1726,"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be."
1727,because I do not see a necessary link between the breach of the requirements of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the interference in the private and family life of Mrs Murray (and her family).
1728,"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
1729,This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.
1730,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
1731," In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 14 above)."
1732,"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention."
1733," There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures."
1734,"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law."
1735,"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison."
1736,"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation."
1737,"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions. "
1738,"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 15 above). "
1739,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  "
1740,"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
1741,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1742,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1743,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  "
1744," The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
1745,"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation."
1746,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.
1747,"The Court notes that Mr Pfarrmeier based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1748,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
1749,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied."
1750,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  "
1751,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
1752,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
1753,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
1754," It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1755,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below. "
1756,"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
1757,It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  
1758,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
1759,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above)."
1760," It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal""."
1761,"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court."
1762,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 21 above)."
1763,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
1764,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
1765,"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction. "
1766,"It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989,"
1767,"Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47)."
1768, My main objection to this paragraph is the following.
1769,"In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
1770," In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature."
1771,"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one."
1772,"Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument."
1773,This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . 
1774, I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria. 
1775,"See, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53; the Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium judgment of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 17, para. 30; see also the Diennet v. France judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 325-A, pp. 13-14, para. 28. "
1776,"I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  ."
1777, This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.
1778,Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).
1779,"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 15 above)."
1780,"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention."
1781," Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature."
1782,"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:"
1783," It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation."
1784," Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision."
1785,Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  
1786,"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""  "
1787,"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  "
1788," The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21)."
1789,They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.
1790,"The Court notes that Mr Pramstaller based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty."
1791,"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied."
1792,"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1978, were applied."
1793," This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court. "
1794,"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 22 above)."
1795,"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters."
1796,"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority."
1797," In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction. "
1798,"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28). "
1799,The Constitutional Court is not such a body.
1800,"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts."
1801,The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.
1802,"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""."
1803,"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below."
1804," The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraph 11 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:"
1805, It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  
1806,"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention."
1807,"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 24 above). "
1808,"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal""."
1809,It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred
1810,"(see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47)."
1811, My main objection to this paragraph is the following.
1812,"In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)."
1813,"In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature."
1814,"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one. "
1815,"I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  ."
1816,"Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument. "
1817,This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . 
1818, I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria.
1819,"See, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53; the Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium judgment of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 17, para. 30; see also the Diennet v. France judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 325-A, pp. 13-14, para. 28."
1820,The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence.
1821,"Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution."
1822,"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations."
1823,it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.
1824,This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable.
1825,"Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous."
1826,"The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail."
1827,"A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31)."
1828,"It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above)."
1829, The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.
1830,"In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended."
1831,It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked.
1832,"Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the ""necessity"" of the interference."
1833, It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith.
1834,"Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above)."
1835,"However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention."
1836,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
1837,The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.
1838,The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it
1839,  The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.
1840,"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities."
1841,"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49)."
1842,"indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed."
1843,"Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice."
1844,"In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued."
1845,This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings.
1846,"Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above)."
1847,"Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive."
1848,"It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46)."
1849,"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above)."
1850,"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it."
1851,"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. "
1852,"In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence."
1853,The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.
1854,"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public."
1855,  It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.
1856,"However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above)."
1857,"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention"
1858, In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.
1859,It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.
1860,"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2)."
1861,The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.
1862,Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.
1863,"Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance."
1864,"However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14)."
1865,In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14).
1866,"instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had been a video showing, for example, the anti-clerical Voltaire having sexual relations with some prince or king."
1867,"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom  applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works."
1868,"Judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 46"
1869,Section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984
1870,"Of course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary."
1871,"It must, if contested, be subject to judicial review, and it must not have the effect of preventing the courts from deciding, as the case may be, whether the work concerned deserves, or does not deserve, any sanction under existing law."
1872,This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case.
1873,It certainly goes too far. 4.
1874,"To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question."
1875,"I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society""."
1876,The British Board of Film Classification and the five-member panel of the VAC took the view that the applicant would commit an offence of blasphemy if his video work Visions of Ecstasy were to be distributed (see paragraph 20 of the judgment).
1877,In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.
1878,The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.
1879,The actual opinion of believers remains unknown. 
1880,"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment)."
1881,"As the Court has consistently held, the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) apply not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that shock or disturb."
1882,Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.
1883,"since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith."
1884,"The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive."
1885,"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above)."
1886,The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.
1887,"As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries."
1888,It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.
1889,In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).
1890,"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above). "
1891,"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49)."
1892,"Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions."
1893,"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations."
1894,"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35)."
1895,This does not of course exclude final European supervision.
1896,Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material
1897,"Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60)."
1898,The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).
1899,"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion."
1900,Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.
1901,"As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control."
1902,"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness."
1903,"The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness."
1904,"Without prejudice to its decision on the objection relating to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court considers that Mr Ahmet Sadik's widow and children have a legitimate moral interest in obtaining a ruling that his conviction infringed the right to freedom of expression which he relied on before the Convention institutions. "
1905,"Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50). "
1906,"The Court notes, firstly, that the applicant was convicted by the Greek courts of disturbing, through his writings, the public peace and the peace of the citizens of Western Thrace."
1907,"Furthermore, it notes that the applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine of GRD 1,000 per day of detention, which sum he paid."
1908,"Relying on the Commission's case-law on the question, they submitted that the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) was so closely and directly bound up with the deceased applicant's person that his heirs could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable them to continue the proceedings in his stead."
1909,"Moreover, the applicant's case was an isolated one which raised no question of general interest. "
1910,since they concerned the name and cultural identity of an entire minority.
1911,"In support of that argument he referred to the very terms of the Government's application bringing the case before the Court, in which they had declared:"
1912,"""the case concerns important national issues and also raises complex legal problems, since it affects the Muslim minority in Western Thrace"". "
1913,It reiterates that the supervision machinery set up by the Convention is subsidiary to the national human rights protection systems.
1914,"Even if the Greek courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention, this cannot have dispensed the applicant from relying on the Convention in those courts or from advancing arguments to the same or like effect before them, thus drawing their attention to the problem he intended to submit subsequently, if need be, to the institutions responsible for European supervision"
1915,"That principle is reflected in the rule set forth in Article 26 (art. 26), which ""dispenses States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system"""
1916,"(see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, para. 50). "
1917,"Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given."
1918,"It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law"
1919,"(see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, para. 50). "
1920,"In its judgment of 16 September 1996 in the case of Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV),"
1921,the Court emphasised that the application of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. 
1922,"(see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34). "
1923,"The Court notes that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law (Article 28 para. 1 of the Constitution - see paragraph 19 above)."
1924,It further notes that Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) is directly applicable;
1925,Mr Ahmet Sadik could therefore have relied on that provision (art. 10) in the Greek courts and complained of a violation thereof in his case. 
1926,"At no time, however, did the applicant rely on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), or on arguments to the same or like effect based on domestic law, in the courts dealing with his case. "
1927," In both the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal the applicant, who, in his appeal on points of law, put forward arguments which were based solely on domestic law and did not raise the matter of freedom of expression (see paragraph 17 above), merely defended himself against the charge of disturbing the peace, contrary to Article 192 of the Criminal Code. "
1928,"(see the Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 19, para. 39)."
1929,They asserted that neither the applicant nor his lawyers had alleged at any stage of the proceedings in the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal - even indirectly or in abstract terms - any infringement whatsoever of the right to freedom of expression.
1930,"The only reason why, in the Court of Cassation, the applicant had asserted his right to use the term ""Turkish"" to designate the Muslims of Western Thrace had been to prove that the act he had committed was not sufficient to make out the objective element of the offence defined in Article 192 of the Criminal Code."
1931," The Government submitted that Mr Ahmet Sadik had not exhausted domestic remedies, not having raised before the national courts, even in substance, the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). "
1932,"While it fell to that court to review the constitutionality of a legislative provision proprio motu, it could not - in the absence of an express application to this effect by the parties - consider whether the provision concerned had been applied to the facts of the case before it in a manner compatible with the Constitution. "
1933,"However, no judicial authority in Greece was disposed to affirm that a member of the ""Turkish minority"" enjoyed such a right."
1934,"Be that as it may, the judge in a criminal case had a duty to take into consideration of his own motion, especially when contemplating imposing a heavy sentence on the defendant, the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and the Convention, which in Greece took precedence over legislation. "
1935,"Obviously, it has often been pointed out that the Court's case-law has evolved considerably since the Convention came into force. "
1936,"But there is one important distinction to be made. While this evolution is normal - subject to the necessary precautions being taken - with regard to the Convention's substantive provisions, it can only be exceptional and limited with regard to the procedural provisions such as the fundamental rule of international law that domestic remedies must be exhausted."
1937," One of the essential arguments against the Court's doctrine that it has jurisdiction to examine afresh preliminary objections already rejected by the Commission is that this doctrine has rather unpalatable effects: it makes it possible, after long years of Strasbourg proceedings, for very important issues to remain undecided ."
1938,"See paragraph 4.2 of my dissenting opinion in the case of Brozicek v. Italy of 19 December 1989 (Series A no. 167, pp. 23 et seq.). My opposition to this doctrine - which has gradually won some support within the Court - was spurned in the Court's judgment of 25 March 1992 in the case of B. v. France (Series A no. 232-C)."
1939,"Applying the above general considerations to the case of Ahmet Sadik I note in the first place that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law  and that, moreover, Article 10 (art. 10) is directly applicable under Greek law."
1940," In this context I recall that the grievances raised by the applicant were very broad: he maintained, inter alia, that the prosecution case should have been dismissed and that the Patras Court of Appeal had not given sufficient reasons for its decision "
1941,"Thus supplementing the arguments would have meant, in the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, that the Greek Supreme Court should also have assessed ex officio whether the applicant's conviction and sentence were proportionate."
1942,"It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression. "
1943,"I note in the second place that, even supposing that the Greek Supreme Court in criminal cases lacks the power to quash of its own motion, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot ex officio supplement legal arguments for grievances put forward by the appellant."
1944,"Consequently, my starting-point is that the Greek Supreme Court, when dealing with the applicant's appeal against his conviction by the Patras Court of Appeal, in principle could and should have applied Article 10 (art. 10) - as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights - ex officio (see paragraph 11 above). "
1945," There is little or no evidence for the Government's thesis on the long-range policy of secession which they see behind the impugned use of the designation ""Turkish""."
1946,Nor is there a scrap of evidence for the assertion that there is a direct or even an indirect causal link between the impugned terminology in the pamphlet of October 1989 and the violence and disorder of 29 January 1990.
1947," In its report referred to in paragraph 4 of the Court's judgment Helsinki Watch suggests that the incidents were rather the work of the majority!"
1948," In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language."
1949,"It follows that neither have I been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were necessary in a democratic society. "
1950,"(see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72)"
1951,"Article 27 of the Convention (art. 27) requires a flexible interpretation without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72), a ""pro victima"" approach in favour of admissibility in order to allow the Convention institutions to consider the alleged complaints. 
"
